<p>One of the most prolific sources of a high sickness and death
rate in the city of New York is developed during the summer
quarter. It has been estimated that from three to five thousand persons
die and sixty to one hundred thousand cases of sickness occur
annually in this city, from causes which are engendered during the
months of June, July, August, and September. An examination of
the records of the Health Department for any year reveals the important
fact that certain diseases are not only more frequent during
the summer quarter than at any other time, but that they are far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
more fatal, especially in the months of July and August, than during
any other period of the year. These are the "zymotic diseases," or
those depending upon some form of germ life. The following table
illustrates the course of mortality from those diseases in one year:</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Mortality from zymotic diseases">
<tr><td align="left">Month.</td><td align="right">Deaths.</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Month.</td><td align="right">Deaths.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">January</td><td align="right">541</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">July</td><td align="right">1,433</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">February</td><td align="right">475</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">August</td><td align="right">1,126</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">March</td><td align="right">476</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">September</td><td align="right">791</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">April</td><td align="right">554</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">October</td><td align="right">522</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">May</td><td align="right">584</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">November</td><td align="right">460</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">June</td><td align="right">798</td><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="left">December</td><td align="right">504</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>It appears that during eight months of the year, excluding June,
July, August, and September, the average monthly mortality from
"zymotic diseases" was 452. Had the same average continued
during the remaining four months the total mortality from those diseases
for that year would have been 4,424; but the actual mortality
was 7,764, which proves that 3,340 persons were sacrificed during
those four fatal months to conditions which exist in the city only at
that period of the year. Still more startling is the estimate of the
sickness rate caused by the unhealthful conditions created in the
summer months in New York city. If we estimate that there are
twenty cases of sickness for every death by a zymotic disease there
were 66,800 more cases of sickness in the year above referred to
than there would have been had the sickness rate been the same in
the summer as in the other months of that year.</p>

<p>One of the saddest features of this high sickness and death rate
appears when we notice the ages of those who are especially the
victims of these fatal diseases. During the week ending July 9th
last there were 399 deaths from diarrh&#339;al diseases, of which number
382 were children under five years of age. The following table
taken from the records of the Health Department show in a very
striking manner how fatal to child life are the conditions peculiar
to our summer season:</p>

<p>These statistics demonstrate the extreme unhealthfulness of New
York during the summer, and the vast proportion of children who
perish from the fatal agencies which are then brought into activity.
It is a matter of great public concern to determine the nature of
the unhygienic conditions on which this excessive mortality depends,
and thus discover the proper remedial measures.</p>

<p>As high temperature is the distinguishing feature of the summer
months, we very naturally conclude that excessive heat is a most important
factor, if not the sole cause, of the diseases so fatal to human
life at this period. A close comparison of the temperature and mortality
records of any summer in this city demonstrates the direct relation
of the former to the latter. For illustration, we will take the
records of the Health Department during the past summer, selecting
diarrh&#339;al diseases for comparison, as they prevail and are
most fatal at that season of the year. The table gives the total
mortality from these diseases and the mortality from those diseases
of children under five years of age. To the four months, June, July,
August, and September, are added May and October, for the purpose
of showing the gradual increase of the mortality from these diseases
as the hot weather approaches and its decline as the hot weather
abates.</p>

<p>Again, if we compare the temperature and mortality records for a
series of days instead of months, it will be noticed that the mortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
record follows the fluctuations of the heat record with as much precision
as effect follows cause. The summer heat generally begins
about the 20th of June and continues with varying intensity until
the 15th of September. Within that period we can select many
examples which strikingly illustrate the relations of temperature to
mortality. For example, the first heated term of the year before us
began on the 19th of June and lasted until the 26th of that month.
The two records are as follows:</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>On the 28th of June a second heated term began, when the
temperature rose to 80&deg;, and continued above that figure until July
5th, a period of eight days. The following is the record, including
the temperature in the sun:</p>

<p>It will be noticed that during the last heated period there was a
more prolonged high temperature than during the first, and that the
mortality of the second was higher for the same temperature than
that of the first. These facts are in accord with the history of our
summer months. The range of temperature increases as the season
advances, and the rate of mortality rises, owing to the diminished
resisting power to the effects of high heat on the part of the people,
especially of the children, the aged, and those already enfeebled by
disease.</p>

<p>In order to fully understand the influence of heat and its effects
upon the public health, we must first notice the conditions regulating
the temperature of the body in health and disease.</p>

<p>The temperature of animals in a state of health is not a fixed
quantity, but has a limited range which depends upon internal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
external conditions not incompatible with health. In man the range
of temperature in health is fixed at 97.25&deg; F. to 99.5&deg; F. Any temperature
above or below these extremes, unless explained by special
circumstances not affecting the normal condition of the person, is
an indication of disease. This comparatively fixed temperature in
health is a remarkable feature of the living animal. When subjected
to a temperature above or below the extremes here given it will
still maintain its equilibrium. This fixed temperature under varying
conditions of heat and cold is due to a "heat-regulating power,"
inherent in the constitution of every animal, by which it imparts
heat when the temperature of the air is high and conserves heat when
the latter is low. The heat escapes from the body&mdash;1, by radiation
from the surface; 2, by transmission to other bodies; 3, by evaporation;
and 4, by the conversion of heat into motion. The surface of
the body furnishes the principal medium for the loss of heat by the
first three methods&mdash;viz., radiation, transmission, and evaporation.
It is estimated that 93.07 per cent of the heat produced escapes by
the processes of radiation, evaporation, conduction, and mechanical
work. The remaining heat units are lost by warming inspired air
and the foods and drinks taken. There are apparently other subtile
influences, so-called "regulators of heat," at work to preserve an
equilibrium of temperature in the animal body, but they are not
well known. The result of the operation of these forces is this&mdash;viz.,
if, by any means, the heat of the body is increased, compensative
losses of heat quickly occur, and the normal temperature is soon
restored; and if, on the contrary, the loss of heat is unusually increased,
the compensative production of heat of the body at once
follows, and the equilibrium is at once restored. The important fact
to remember is this&mdash;viz., the production and loss of heat in the
human organism when in health and not subjected to too violent disturbing
causes are so nicely balanced that the temperature is always
maintained at an average of 98.6&deg; F., the extremes being 97.25&deg; F.
and 99.5&deg; F. "So beautifully is this balance preserved," Parkes
remarks, "that the stability of the animal temperature in all countries
has always been a subject of marvel." If, however, anything
prevents the operation of the processes of cooling&mdash;viz., radiation,
evaporation, and conduction&mdash;the bodily temperature rises by the
accumulation of heat, and death is the result from combustion. In
experiments in ovens a man has been able to bear a temperature of
260&deg; F. for a short period, provided the air was dry so that evaporation
could be carried on rapidly. But if the air is very moist, and
perspiration is impeded, the temperature of the body rises rapidly,
and the person soon succumbs to the excessive heat. Another important
fact is this, viz., the normal temperature of the young and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
of the very old is higher than the middle-aged. The infant at
birth has a temperature of 99&deg; F. to 100&deg; F., and it maintains
a temperature of 99&deg; F. and upward for several days. The variations
of temperature from other causes are much greater in children
than in adults, as also the normal daily variations of temperature.
About the sixtieth year the average temperature of
man begins to rise, and approximates that of the infant. In the
young and old the "heat-regulating power" is more readily exhausted,
and hence continued high temperature is far more fatal to
these classes.</p>

<p>The first noticeable fact in regard to bodily temperature in disease
is that there are daily fluctuations as in health, but much more
extreme. In general, the remission of temperature in disease occurs
in the morning, and the exacerbation in the afternoon and evening;
the minimum is reached between six and nine o'clock in the morning,
and the maximum between three and six o'clock in the evening. In
many diseases the minimum temperature is not below 100&deg; F., and
usually it is one or two degrees above that point, while the maximum
has no definite limit and may reach the dangerous height of 107&deg; F.
It should be noticed that the highest daily temperature in disease, as
in health, occurs in the afternoon, when the temperature of the air
in summer is the greatest.</p>

<p>The conditions affecting the temperature of the body other than
those due to physiological conditions are very numerous. First and
most obvious is the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. It
is a well-established fact that an average temperature of the air of
54&deg; F. is best adapted to the public health, for at that temperature
the decomposition of animal and vegetable matter is slight, and normal
temperature is most easily maintained. Every degree of temperature
above or below that point requires a more or less effort
of the heat-regulating power to maintain the proper equilibrium.
Even more potent in elevating the bodily temperature is the introduction
into the blood, whether by respiration or by direct injection,
of putrid fluids and the gases of decomposing matters. If this injection
is repeated at short intervals, death will occur with a high
temperature. The air of cities contains emanations, in hot weather,
from a vast number of sources of animal and vegetable decomposition,
and the inhalation of air so vitiated brings in contact with the
blood these deleterious products in a highly divided state which
cause a fatal elevation of temperature in the young, old, and enfeebled.
The same effect is produced by the air in close and heated
places, as in tenement houses, workshops, schoolhouses, hospital
wards, and other rooms where many persons congregate for hours.
Air thus charged with poisonous gases becomes more dangerous if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
the temperature of the place is raised, as happens almost daily in
the summer months in cities.</p>

<p>From the preceding facts we may conclude that, as long as the
body continues in health, the "heat-regulating power," which constantly
tends to preserve an equilibrium of temperature, is capable
of resisting the ordinary agencies that, operating externally or internally,
exaggerate the heat-producing conditions, and thus destroy
the individual. But if the person is suffering from a disease which
weakens the "heat-regulating power" these deleterious agencies,
which the healthy person may resist, will readily overpower the
already quite exhausted heat-regulating forces, and he perishes by
combustion. It is very evident that in an organism having complicated
functions, like that of man, and subject to such a multitude of
adverse influences, the balance between health and disease must be
very nicely adjusted. Too great an elevation or too great a depression
of temperature may destroy the "heat-regulating power," and disease
or death will be the consequence. Or this "heat-regulating
power" may be weakened or destroyed by causes generated within
the body, or received from without, and the heat-producing agencies
are then under influences which may prove to be powerfully destructive
forces.</p>

<p>It will not now be difficult to understand in what manner high
temperature affects the public health of large cities. Evidently in
the <i>direct</i> action of heat upon the human body we have the most
powerful agency in the production of our great summer mortality.
While sunstroke represents the maximum direct effect of solar heat
upon the human subject, the large increase of deaths from wasting
chronic diseases and diarrh&#339;al affections, of children under one year
of age and persons upward of seventy years of age, shows the terrible
effects of the prevailing intense heat of summer upon all who are
debilitated by disease or age and thereby have their "heat-regulating
power" diminished. The fact has been established by repeated experiment
that when solar or artificial heat is continually applied to
the animal the temperature of its body will gradually rise until all
of the compensating or heat-regulating agencies fail to preserve the
equilibrium, and the temperature reaches a point at which death
takes place from actual combustion. In general, a temperature of
107&deg; F. in man would be regarded as indicating an unfavorable termination
of any disease. In persons suffering from sunstroke the
temperature often ranges from 106&deg; F. to 110&deg; F., the higher temperature
appearing just before a fatal termination.</p>

<p>The <i>indirect</i> effects of heat appear in the production of poisonous
gases which vitiate the air and render it more or less prejudicial
to health. Decomposition of all forms of refuse animal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
vegetable matter proceeds with far greater rapidity during the summer
quarter than during other months of the year. Among the
early results of summer heat is the damage to food. Milk retailed
through the city, the sole or chief diet of thousands of hand-fed
infants, undergoes such changes as to render it not only less nutritious
but also hurtful to the digestive organs. The vegetables and
fruits in the markets rapidly deteriorate and become unfit for food.
Meats and fish quickly take on putrefactive changes which render
them more or less indigestible. The effect of this increase of temperature
upon the refuse and filth of the streets, courts, and alleys,
upon the air in close places, in the tenement houses, and upon the
tenants themselves is soon perceptible. The foul gases of decomposition
fill the atmosphere of the city and render the air of close and
unventilated places stifling; while languor, depression, and debility
fall upon the population like a widespread epidemic. The physician
now recognizes the fact that a new element has entered into the
medical constitution of the season. The sickly young, the enfeebled
old, those exhausted from wasting diseases, whose native energies
were just sufficient to maintain their tenure of life, are the first to
succumb to this pressure upon their vital resources. Diarrh&#339;al diseases
of every form next appear and assume a fatal intensity, and
finally the occurrence of sunstroke (or heat-stroke) determines the
maximum effects of heat upon the public health. The sickness records
of dispensaries and the mortality records of the Health Department
show that a new and most destructive force is now operating,
not only in the diseases above mentioned, but in nearly all of the diseases
of the period. Fevers, inflammatory diseases, and others of a
similar nature run a more rapid course, and are far less amenable to
treatment. This is due, in the opinion of eminent medical authority,
to the addition of the heat of the air to the heat of the body. Indeed,
the only safety is in flight from the city to the country and to cool
localities, as the seashore or the mountains. The immediate improvement
of those suffering from affections of the city when transferred
to the country is often marvelous, and shows conclusively
how fatal is the element of heat in its direct and indirect effects upon
the residents of the city.</p>

<p>Let us next consider the causes of high temperature in the city
of New York. It is a well-established fact that the temperature of
large and densely populated towns is far higher than the surrounding
country. This is due to a variety of causes, the chief of which
are the absence of vegetation; the drainage and hence the dryness of
the soil; the covering of the earth with stone, bricks, and mortar;
the aggregation of population to surface area; the massing together
of buildings; and the artificial heat of workshops and manufactories.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
The difference between the mean temperature of the city at Cooper
Institute and at the Arsenal, Central Park, for a single month, illustrates
this fact. Another striking difference between the temperature
of these two points of observation is that the range is much
greater at Central Park than at Cooper Institute, the temperature
falling at night more at the former than at the latter place. The
effect of vegetation is to lower the temperature at night, while brick
and stone retain the heat and prevent any considerable fall of temperature
during the twenty-four hours. It may be said of New York
that it has all the conditions of increased temperature above given
in an intensified form. It has a southern exposure; all of its broad
avenues run north and south; the surface is covered with stone, brick,
and asphalt; it is destitute of vegetation except in its parks, which
have a very limited area compared with the needs of the city; its
buildings are irregularly arranged and crowded together so as to give
the largest amount of elevation with the least superficial area; ventilation
of courts, areas, and living rooms is sacrificed; its ill-constructed
and overcrowded tenement houses, especially of certain districts,
have the largest population to surface area of any city in the
civilized world. To these natural and structural unfavorable sanitary
conditions must be added the enormous production of artificial
heat in dwellings. When the summer temperature begins to rise
the solar heat is constantly added to the artificial heat already existing.
The temperature of the whole vast mass of stones, bricks, mortar, and
asphalt gradually increases, with no other mitigation or modification
than that caused by the inconstant winds and occasional rainstorms.
And the evils of high temperature are yearly increasing as the area
of brick, stone, and asphalt extends. The records of sunstroke
during the past few years is appalling, both on account of the number
of cases and their comparative increase. If no adequate remedy is
discovered and applied, the day would not seem to be distant when
the resident, especially if he is a laborer, will remain in the city
and pursue his work during the summer at the constant risk of his
life.</p>

<p>Turning now to consider the question of the measures which are
best adapted to protect the present and future population of New
York from the effects of high summer temperatures, we are met by
many suggestions of more or less value. The more important methods
proposed are: a large supply of public baths; the daily flushing
of the streets with an immense volume of river water; recreation
piers; excursions to the seashore; temporary residence in the country,
etc. But these are for the most part temporary expedients, applicable
to individuals, and are but accessory to some more radical
measure which aims to so change the atmospheric conditions that excessive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
heat can not occur. The real problem to be solved may be
thus stated: How can the temperature of the city of New York be so
modified during the summer months as to prevent that extreme degree
of heat on which the enormous sickness and death rate of the
people depend? Discussing the subject broadly from this standpoint,
it becomes at once evident that we must employ those agencies
which in the wide field of Nature are designed to mitigate heat and
purify the air and thus create permanent climatic conditions favorable
for the habitation of man.</p>

<p>It requires but little knowledge of the physical forces which
modify the climate of large areas of the earth's surface to recognize
the fact that vegetation plays a most important part. And of the
different forms of vegetation, trees, as compared with shrubs, plants,
vines, and grasses, are undoubtedly the most efficient. This is due to
the vast area of surface which their leaves present to the air on a
very limited ground space. The sanitary value of trees has hitherto
been practically unrecognized by man. With the most ruthless hand
he has everywhere and at all times sacrificed this most important
factor in the conservation of a healthful and temperate climate. He
has found, too late, however, that by this waste of the forests he
has by no means improved his own condition. The winters have become
colder, the summers hotter; the living springs have ceased to
flow perpetually; the fertilizing streams have disappeared; the earth
is deeply frozen in winter and parched in summer; and, finally, new
and grave diseases have appeared where formerly they were unknown.</p>

<p>It is well understood that the temperature in a forest, a grove,
or even a clump of trees, is cooler in summer and warmer in winter
than the surrounding country. Man and animals alike seek
the shade of groves and trees during the heat of the day, and are
greatly refreshed and revived by the cool atmosphere. The difference
between the temperature of the air under and among the
branches of a single tree, densely leaved, and the surrounding air,
on a hot day, is instantly realized by the laborer or traveler who
seeks the shade. The thermometer in the sun and shade shows a difference
of twenty, thirty, and forty degrees, and in the soil a difference
of ten to eleven degrees. The reverse is true in winter. The
laborer and traveler exposed to the cold of the open country find
in the forest a degree of warmth quite as great as in a building but
imperfectly inclosed. Railroad engineers inform us that they have
occasion to use far less fuel in passing through forests in winter than
in traversing the same distance in the open country. When the
ground in the fields is frozen two or three feet deep, its temperature
in the forest is found above the freezing point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>Forests and even single trees have, therefore, a marked influence
upon the surrounding atmosphere, especially during the summer,
and they evidently tend to equalize temperature, preventing extremes
both in summer and winter. Hence they become of immense value
as sanitary agencies in preserving equality of climatic conditions.</p>

<p>It is believed by some vegetable physiologists that trees exert
this power through their own inherent warmth, which always remains
at a fixed standard both in summer and winter. "Observation
shows," says Meguscher,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "that the wood of a living tree maintains
a temperature of from 54&deg; to 56&deg; F., when the temperature stands
from 37&deg; to 47&deg; F. above zero, and that the internal warmth does
not rise and fall in proportion to that of the atmosphere. So long
as the latter is below 67&deg; F., that of the tree is always highest; but,
if the temperature of the air rises to 67&deg; F., that of the vegetable
growth is the lowest." Since, then, trees maintain at all seasons a
constant mean temperature of 54&deg; F., it is easy to see why the air in
contact with the forest must be warmer in winter and cooler in summer
than in situations where it is deprived of that influence.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Again, the shade of trees protects the earth from the direct rays
of the sun, and prevents solar irradiation from the earth. This effect
is of immense importance in cities where the paved streets become
excessively heated, and radiation creates one of the most dangerous
sources of heat. Whoever has walked in the streets of New York,
on a hot summer's day, protected from the direct rays of a midday
sun by his umbrella, has found the reflected heat of the pavement
intolerable. If for a moment he passed into the dense shade of a
tree, he at once experienced a marked sense of relief. This relief is
not due so much to the shade as to the cooling effect of the vaporization
from the leaves of the tree.</p>

<p>Trees also have a cutaneous transpiration by their leaves. And
although they absorb largely the vapor of the surrounding air, and
also the water of the soil, they nevertheless exhale constantly large
volumes into the air. This vaporization of liquids is a frigorific or
cooling process, and when most rapid the frigorific effect reaches its
maximum. The amount of fluid exhaled by vegetation has been, at
various times, estimated with more or less accuracy. Hales<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> states
that a sunflower, with a surface of 5.616 square inches, throws off at
the rate of twenty to twenty-four ounces avoirdupois every twelve
hours; a vine, with twelve square feet of foliage, exhales at the
rate of five or six ounces daily. Bishop Watson, in his experiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
on grasses, estimated that an acre of grass emits into the atmosphere
6.400 quarts of water in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that vegetation tends powerfully to cool
the atmosphere during a summer day, and this effect increases in proportion
to the increase of the temperature. The influence of trees
heavily leaved, in a district where there is no other vegetation, in
moderating and equalizing the temperature, can not be overestimated.
The amount of superficial surface exposed by the foliage of
a single tree is immense. For example, "the Washington elm, of
Cambridge, Mass., a tree of moderate size, was estimated several
years since to produce a crop of seven million leaves, exposing a surface
of two hundred thousand square feet, or about five acres of
foliage."</p>

<p>Trees regulate the humidity of the air by the process of absorption
and transpiration. They absorb the moisture contained in the
air, and again return to the air, in the form of vapor, the water which
they have absorbed from the earth and the air. The flow of sap in
trees for the most part ceases at night, the stimulus of light and heat
being necessary to the function of absorption and evaporation. During
the heated portions of the day, therefore, when there is the most
need of agencies to equalize both temperature and humidity, trees
perform their peculiar functions most actively. Moisture is rapidly
absorbed from the air by the leaves, and from the earth by the roots,
and is again all returned to the air and earth by transpiration or
exudation. The effect of this process upon temperature and humidity
is thus stated by Marsh: "The evaporation of the juices of the
plant by whatever process effected, takes up atmospheric heat and
produces refrigeration. This effect is not less real, though much less
sensible in the forest than in meadow and pasture land, and it can
not be doubted that the local temperature is considerably affected
by it. But the evaporation that cools the air diffuses through it,
at the same time, a medium which powerfully resists the escape of
heat from the earth by radiation. Visible vapor or clouds, it is well
known, prevent frosts by obstructing radiation, or rather by reflecting
back again the heat radiated by the earth, just as any mechanical
screen would do. On the other hand, clouds intercept the rays
of the sun also, and hinder its heat from reaching the earth." Again,
he says, upon the whole, their general effect "seems to be to mitigate
extremes of atmospheric heat and cold, moisture and drought. They
serve as equalizers of temperature and humidity."</p>

<p>Again, let us notice the effects of trees upon malarial emanations.
The power of trees, when in leaf, to render harmless the
poisonous emanations from the earth has long been an established
fact. Man may live in close proximity to marshes from which arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
the most dangerous malaria with the utmost impunity, provided a
grove intervene between his home and the marsh. This function of
trees was known to the Romans, who enacted laws requiring the
planting of trees in places made uninhabitable by the diffusion of
malaria, and placed groves serving such purposes under the protection
of some divinity to insure their protection. It is a rule of the
British army in India to select an encampment having a grove between
the camp and any low, wet soil.</p>

<p>Finally, trees purify the atmosphere. The process of vegetable
nutrition consists in the appropriation by the plant or tree of carbon.
This element it receives from the air in the form principally of carbonic
acid, and in the process of digestion the oxygen is liberated
and again restored to the air, while the carbon becomes fixed as an
element of the woody fiber. Man and animals, on the contrary, require
oxygen for their nutrition, and the supply is in the air they
breathe. Carbon is a waste product of the animal system, and, uniting
with the oxygen, is expired as carbonic acid, a powerful animal
poison. A slight increase of the normal quantity of carbonic acid
in the air renders it poisonous to man, and continued respiration of
such air, or a considerable increase of the carbonic acid, will prove
fatal. The animal and vegetable world, therefore, complement each
other, and the one furnishes the conditions and forces by which the
other maintains life and health. "Plants," says Schacht, "imbibe
from the air carbonic acid and other gaseous or volatile products exhaled
by animals, developed by the natural phenomena of decomposition.
On the other hand, the vegetable pours into the atmosphere
oxygen, which is taken up by animals and appropriated by them.
The tree, by means of its leaves and its young herbaceous twigs, presents
a considerable surface for absorption and evaporation; it abstracts
the carbon of carbonic acid, and solidifies it in wood fecula,
and a multitude of other compounds. The result is that a forest
withdraws from the air, by its great absorbent surface, much more
gas than meadows or cultivated fields, and exhales proportionally a
considerably greater quantity of oxygen. The influence of the forests
on the chemical composition of the atmosphere is, in a word, of
the highest importance."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In large cities, where animal and vegetable decomposition goes
on rapidly during the summer, the atmosphere is, as already stated,
at times saturated with deleterious gases. At the period of the day
when malaria and mephitic gases are emitted in the greatest quantity
and activity, this function of absorption by vegetation is most active
and powerful. Carbonic acid, ammoniacal compounds, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
gases, products of putrefaction, so actively poisonous to man, are
absorbed, and in the process of vegetable digestion the deleterious
portion is separated and appropriated by the plant, while oxygen,
the element essential to animal life, is returned to the air. Trees,
therefore, in cities, are of immense value, owing to their power to
destroy or neutralize malaria, and to absorb the poisonous elements
of gaseous compounds, while they render the air more respirable by
emitting oxygen.</p>

<p>The conclusion from the foregoing facts is inevitable that one of
the great and pressing sanitary wants of New York city is an ample
supply of trees. It is, in effect, destitute of trees; for the unsightly
shrubs which are planted by citizens are, in no proper sense, adequate
to the purpose which we contemplate. Its long avenues, running
north and south, without a shade tree, and exposed to the full effect
of the sun, are all but impassable at noonday in the summer months.
The pedestrian who ventures out at such an hour finds no protection
from an umbrella, on account of the radiation of the intense heat
from the paved surface. Animals and man alike suffer from exposure
in the glowing heat. Nothing mitigates its intensity but
the winds or an occasional rainstorm. And when evening comes on,
the cooling of the atmosphere produced by vegetation does not occur,
and unless partially relieved by favoring winds or a shower the
heat continues, but little abated, and the atmosphere remains charged
with noxious and irrespirable gases. It is evident that shade trees,
of proper kinds, and suitably arranged, supply the conditions necessary
to counteract the evils of excessive heat. They protect the
paved streets and the buildings largely from the direct rays of the
sun; they cool the lower stratum of air by evaporation from their
immense surfaces of leaves; they absorb at once the malarious
emanations and gases of decomposition, and abstract their poisonous
properties for their own consumption; they withdraw from the air
the carbonic acid thrown off from the animal system as a poison, and
decomposing it, appropriate the element dangerous to man, and give
back to the atmosphere the element essential to his health and even
life.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>And we may add that cultivated shade trees in New York would
be an artistic and attractive feature of the streets. Every citizen
enjoys trees, as is evident from the efforts made to cultivate them
throughout the city.</p>

<p>It is frequently alleged that trees can not be successfully cultivated
in cities on account of the gases in the soil. There are ample
proofs to the contrary. The city of Paris strikingly illustrates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
possibility of cultivating a large variety of trees in the streets and
public places of large cities when the planting and cultivation is
placed under competent authority. In our own country the cities of
New Haven and Washington are examples of the successful cultivation
of trees to an extent sufficient to greatly modify the summer
temperature. Authorities on landscape gardening and forestry sustain
the view that under proper supervision by competent and skilled
persons a great variety of trees, shrubs, plants, and vines can be
cultivated in the streets and public places of this city. Mr. Frederick
Law Olmstead, to whom the city is so much indebted for his intelligent
supervision of Central Park in its early period, warmly
supported a movement to cultivate trees, shrubs, plants, and vines
in the streets of New York. Dr. J.T. Rothrock, the very able and
experienced Commissioner of Forestry of Pennsylvania, under date
of October 10, 1898, speaking of the proposed plan of securing the
cultivating trees in the streets of this city, remarks: "I think it an
excellent measure, and I am sure that during the torrid season the
more tree shade you have the fewer will be your cases of heat exhaustion.
It is idle to say, as is often said in this country, that trees
can not be made to grow in our cities. Under existing conditions
the wonder is, not that trees look unhealthy in most cities, but that
any of them manage to live at all. It is perfectly well known that
the city of Paris has thousands of trees growing vigorously under
such surroundings as the American gardener would think impossible.
Two things are necessary to success&mdash;viz., first, the kinds of
trees to endure city life must be found; and, second, select from
among them such as are adapted by their size and shape to each
special place."</p>

<p>Mr. Gifford Pinchot, of the Division of Forestry, Department
of Agriculture, Washington, writes under date of December 2,
1898: "Street trees are successfully planted in great numbers in all
of the most beautiful cities of the world. Washington and Paris are
conspicuous examples. That such trees succeed is largely due to the
great care taken in setting them out. The attractiveness of cities
has come to be reckoned among their business advantages, and nothing
adds to it more than well-selected, well-planted, and well-cared-for
trees. On the score of public health trees in the streets of cities
are equally desirable. They become objectionable only when badly
selected and badly maintained."</p>

<p>In a recent paper on Tree Planting in the Streets of Washington,
Mr. W.P. Richards, surveyor of the District of Columbia, remarks
that, under the plan adopted, "tree planting has never been at an experimental
stage" in that city. "Washington was a city of young
trees during the seventies, and in the spring of 1875 more than six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
thousand trees were planted, consisting of silver maples, Norway
maples, American elms, American and European lindens, sugar
maples, tulip trees, American white ash, scarlet maples, various
poplars, and ash-leaved maples.... A careful count was made
of the trees in 1887, and by comparing this with the number of
trees since planted and those removed, there is found to be more
than seventy-eight thousand trees, which if placed thirty feet apart
would line both sides of a boulevard between Washington and
New York. These consist of more than thirty varieties." Mr.
Richards adds: "The planting and care of trees in Washington grows
from year to year, and the future will probably demand more skill
and judgment than in years past. About twenty thousand dollars
is spent annually, most of it in the care of old trees. From one to
three thousand young trees are planted during the spring and fall
of each year. The nursery has several thousand of the best varieties
ready for planting."</p>

<p>The opinions of these authorities and the success of the work in
Washington, now extending over a quarter of a century, determine
beyond all question the feasibility and practicability of successfully
cultivating trees in the streets of cities. And if any one doubts the
power of trees cultivated in the streets to change the temperature
of a city let him calculate the amount of foliage which the seventy-eight
thousand trees, when full-grown, will furnish the city of Washington,
taking as his basis the fact that a single tree, the Washington
elm, at Cambridge, Massachusetts, when in full leafage, equals five
acres of foliage, and that one acre of grass emits into the atmosphere
6.400 quarts of water in twenty-four hours, a powerfully cooling
process.</p>

<p>We have, finally, to consider through what agency the proposed
cultivation of trees in the city of New York can be accomplished
most rapidly and successfully. Three methods may be suggested,
viz.: 1. Encourage citizens each to plant and cultivate trees on his
own premises. 2. Organize voluntary "tree-planting associations,"
which shall aid citizens or undertake to do the work at a
minimum cost. 3. Place the work under the entire supervision and
jurisdiction of public authority. The first method has been on trial
from the foundation of the city, and its results are a few stunted
apologies for trees which are useless for sanitary purposes and unsightly
for ornamentation. The average citizen is entirely incompetent
either to select the proper tree or to cultivate it when
planted. Tree-planting associations have proved useful agencies in
exciting a popular interest in the subject, and in aiding citizens in
the selection of suitable trees and in cultivating them. The Tree-Planting
and Fountain Society of Brooklyn, under the very able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
management of its accomplished secretary, Prof. Lewis Collins, is a
model organization of the kind, and has accomplished a vast amount
of good in this field in that city. But it may well be questioned if we
have not reached a period of sanitary reform in cities when a work
of the kind we contemplate in New York should not be undertaken
by the strong arm of the city government, as a matter of public
policy, and carried steadily forward to its completion. The growth
of the greater city is far too rapid in every direction to await the slow
movements of the people under the pressure of voluntary organizations.
The best work can be done in those outlying districts where
the streets are as yet but sparsely built upon, and the soil has been
undisturbed. Again, it is of the utmost importance that a work of
this kind, which will largely prove one of city ornamentation, should
be under the exclusive direction of a skilled central authority having
ample power and means to harmonize every feature of the work
from the center of the city to its remotest limits. Finally, the successful
cultivation of trees and other vegetation in our streets can be
successfully carried on only by experts in the art of tree culture, who
devote their entire time and energies to these duties, and are sustained
by the power of the city government. Mr. Frederick Law
Olmstead remarks, "Not one in a hundred of all that may have
been planted in the streets of our American cities in the last fifty
years has had such treatment that its species would come to be if
properly planted and cared for." Mr. Richards, in the paper referred
to on Tree Planting in the Streets of Washington, makes the
following statement: "The selection, planting, and care of all trees
in the streets of Washington are under the direction of the District
authorities; individual preferences and private enterprises are not
allowed to regulate this improvement, as is generally done in other
cities. Moreover, the city has its own nursery, where seeds planted
from its own trees grow and supply all the needed varieties."</p>

<p>It is apparent that to accomplish such a work as we propose the
undertaking must be placed under the jurisdiction of a department
of the city government, skilled in the performance of such duties,
fully equipped with all needful appliances, and clothed with ample
power and supplied with the financial resources necessary to overcome
every obstacle. Fortunately, we have in our Department of
Parks an organized branch of the city administration endowed
with every qualification for the performance of these duties. The
charter provides as follows: "It shall be the duty of each commissioner
... to maintain the beauty and utility of all such parks,
squares, and public places as are situated within his jurisdiction, and
to institute and execute all measures for the improvement thereof for
ornamental purposes and for the beneficial uses of the people of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
city, ... and he shall have power to plant trees and to construct,
erect, and establish seats, drinking fountains, statues, and works of
art, when he may deem it tasteful or appropriate so to do." At
the head of this service is "a landscape architect, skilled and expert,
whose assent shall be requisite to all plans and works or
changes thereof respecting the conformation, development, or ornamentation
of any of the parks, squares, or public places of the city,
to the end that the same may be uniform and symmetrical at all
times."</p>

<p>The conclusion seems inevitable that public policy requires that,
in the interests of the health of the people and the comfort and well-being
of that large class of the poor who can not escape the summer
heat by leaving the city, the jurisdiction of the Park Department
should be extended to all trees, shrubs, plants, and vines now and
hereafter planted and growing in the streets of New York, and that
said department should be required to plant such additional trees,
shrubs, etc., as it may from time to time deem necessary and expedient
for the purpose of carrying out the intent and purpose of such
act which should be declared to be to improve the public health, to
render the city comfortable to its summer residents, and for ornamentation.</p>

<h2>MIVART'S GROUNDWORK OF SCIENCE.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Prof. WILLIAM KEITH BROOKS.</span></p>

<p>If books like this by Professor Mivart, who holds that "the groundwork
of science must be sought in the human mind," help to teach
that the greatest service of science to mankind is not "practical," but
intellectual, they are worthy the consideration of the thoughtful,
even if this consideration should lead some of the thoughtful to distrust
Mivart's groundwork, or to doubt whether it is firm enough for
any superstructure.</p>

<p>Many, no doubt, think the desire to know a sufficient groundwork
for science, believing that they wish to know in order that they
may rightly order their lives; but the school to which Mivart belongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
tells them all this is mere vulgar ignorance, since the groundwork of
science is, and must be, something known, rather than a humble
wish to know.</p>

<p>According to Mivart, the groundwork of science consists of truths
which can not be obtained by reasoning, and can not depend for
their certainty on any experiments or observations alone, since whatever
truths depend upon reasoning can not be ultimate, but must be
posterior to, and depend upon, the principles, observations, or experiments
which show that it is indeed true, and upon which its acceptance
thus depends. The groundwork of science must therefore
be composed, he says, of truths which are self-evident; and he assures
us that, if this were not the case, natural knowledge would be mere
"mental paralysis and self-stultification."</p>

<p>He would tell the wayfarer who, having been lost among the
mountains, comes at last upon a broad highway winding around the
foothills and stretching down over the plain to the horizon, that an
attempt to go anywhere upon this road is "mere paralysis," unless he
knows where it begins and where it ends. He would have told the
ancient dwellers upon the shores of the Nile that their belief that
they owed to the river their agriculture, their commerce, their art
and science, and all their civilization, was mere self-stultification,
because they knew nothing of its sources in the central table-land.</p>

<p>May not one believe, with Mivart, that the scientific knowledge
which arises in the mind by means of the senses through contact with
the world of Nature, thus arises by virtue of our innate reason, and
yet find good ground for asking whether physical science may not
have something useful and important to tell us about the mechanism
and history of this innate reason itself? Is proof that our reason
is innate, or born with us, proof that it is ultimate or necessary or
beyond the reach of improvement and development by the application
of natural knowledge? May not this reason itself prove, perhaps,
to be a mechanical <i>phenomenon</i> of matter and motion, and a part of
the discoverable order of physical causation; and may not science
some time tell us how it became innate, and what it is worth?</p>

<p>Questions of this sort are easy to ask but hard to answer; for
many hold our only way to reach an answer to be <i>to find out</i> by scientific
research and discovery. While this method may be too slow
for <i>a priori</i> philosophers, may it not be wise for those who, being
no philosophers, know of no short cut to natural knowledge, to admit
that, while they would like to know more, they have not yet learned
all there is to learn? If this suspension of judgment is indeed self-stultification,
the case of many students is hard, though they may not
really find themselves so helpless as they are told that they must be;
for he who is told by the learned faculty that he is paralyzed need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
not be greatly troubled if he finds his powers for work as much at
his command as they were before.</p>

<p>The modern student has heard so many versions of the story of
the two-faced shield that he is much disposed to suspect that many
of the questions which have so long divided "philosophers" may
be only new illustrations of the old fable, and he asks whether there
need be any real antagonism between those who attribute knowledge
to experience and those who attribute it to our innate reason.</p>

<p>There are men of science who, seeing no good reason to challenge
Plato's belief that experience, creating nothing, only calls forth the
"ideas" which were already dormant or latent in the mind, do nevertheless
find reason to ask whether exhaustive knowledge of our
physical history may not some time show how these dormant "ideas"
came to be what they are. They ask whether errors may not be judgments
which lead us into danger and tend to our physical destruction,
and whether it may not be because a judgment has, in the long run,
proved preservative in the struggle for existence that we call it true.
May not, for example, the difference between the error that the
stick half in water is bent and the truth that the stick in air is
straight, some time prove to be that the savage who has rectified his
judgment has speared his fish, while he who has not has lost his
dinner?</p>

<p>So long as we can ask such questions as this, how can we be sure
that because a judgment is no more than might have been expected
from us, as Nature has made us, at our present intellectual level, it
is either necessary or ultimate or universal? Things that are innate
or natural are not always necessary or universal, for while reason is
natural to the mind of man, some men are unreasonable, and a few
have been even known to be illogical.</p>

<p>It therefore seems clear that another view of the groundwork of
science than that set forth by Professor Mivart is possible, for many
believe that this groundwork is to be found in our desire to know
what we do not yet know, rather than in things known; and they believe
they wish to know in order that they may learn to distinguish
truth from error, and walk with sure feet where the ignorant grope
and stumble.</p>

<p>Many books are profitable and instructive even if they fail to convince;
and the question which a prospective student of Mivart's book
is likely to ask is whether it is consistent with itself; for if the
author has not so far made himself master of his subject as to state
his case without palpable contradiction, no one will expect much
help from him. It is a remark of Aristotle, in the Introduction to
the Parts of Animals, that while one may need special training to
tell whether an author has proved his point, all may judge whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
he is consistent with himself, and the attempt to learn whether
Mivart's book is consistent may not greatly tax our minds.</p>

<p>He tells us that many men of science are "idealists"; and he
says that idealism, being mere self-stultifying skepticism, must be refuted
and demolished before we can begin our search for the groundwork
of science or be sure that we know anything. It would have
surprised Berkeley not a little to be told that his notions are the
very essence of skepticism, for the good bishop tells us again and
again that his only motive in writing is to make an end of idle skepticism,
once for all, that they who are no philosophers, but simple,
honest folks, may come by their own and live at ease.</p>

<p>There is little ease, and less justice, even at this late day, for the
man of science who insists that he is neither an idealist nor a materialist
nor a monist, but a naturalist; and that it will be time enough
to have an opinion as to the relation between mind and matter when
we find out; but many will, no doubt, be pleased to hear that the
crime of which they are now suspected is no longer "materialism,"
but "idealism," for the public attaches no odium to the idealist,
whatever may be Professor Mivart's verdict. Still all must feel an
interest in the exposure of the weakness of idealism, since we have
been told, by many shrewd thinkers, that Berkeley's statement of
the case, while inconclusive, is unanswerable; although they hold
that it is lack of experimental evidence which stands in the way of
either its acceptance or its refutation.</p>

<p>Mivart begins his treatment of idealism by a simple and satisfactory
summary, pages 36-38, of Berkeley's Principles, but he forgets
it on the next page, for it is no exaggeration to assert that the
"idealism" which he refutes is a mere parody on that which he has
just given his readers, and something that no sane man would dream
of holding.</p>

<p>For example, he admits, on page 38, that nothing "can be more
absurd than the criticism of those persons who say that idealists, to
be consistent, ought to run up against lamp-posts, fall into ditches,
and commit other like absurdities." On page 47 he undertakes to
show, "by the natural spontaneous judgment of mankind," that external
material bodies exist "of themselves, and have a substantial
reality in addition to that of the qualities we perceive; because the
spontaneous judgment of mankind accords with what even animals
learn through their senses. A wide river is an objective obstacle
to the progress of a man's dog, as well as to that of the dog's
owner."</p>

<p>One who compares the extract from page 38 with this from page
47 can, so far as I can see, reconcile them only by one of these hypotheses:
1, that Mivart holds a wide river to afford proof of reality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
which is not afforded by a ditch; or, 2, that the dog which does not
run against lamp-posts affords evidence of the reality of Nature which
is not afforded by a man in the same circumstances; or, 3, that "nothing
can be more absurd than the criticism of these persons" who
reason like Professor Mivart.</p>

<p>While sometimes right and sometimes wrong, like the rest of us,
the apostle of tar water was no fool, although the groundwork of
Mivart's science, in the book before us, is the assertion that idealists
idiotically deny everything which they have not perceived, and hold
that the external world has no existence.</p>

<p>It is hard to see how words could be clearer than those in which
Berkeley repudiates all nonsense of this sort. "I do not argue," says
he, "against the existence of any one thing that we apprehend,
<i>either by sense or by reflection</i>. That the things I see with my eyes
and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least
question. I am of a vulgar cast, simple enough to believe my own
senses, and to take things as I find them. To be plain, it is my
opinion that the real things are the very things that I see and feel,
and perceive by my senses. I can not for my life help thinking that
snow is white and fire hot. And as I am no skeptic with regard to
the nature of things, so neither am I as to their existence. That a
thing should be really perceived by my senses, and at the same time
not really exist, is to me a plain contradiction. Wood, stone, fire,
water, flesh, iron, and the like things, which I name and discourse
of, are things I know. Away, then, with all that skepticism, all
those ridiculous philosophical doubts! I might as well doubt of
my own being as of the being of those things I actually see and
feel."</p>

<p>Mivart lays great stress upon the opinion of men in general as a
refutation of idealism; and as Berkeley also says he is content to
appeal to the common sense of the world, it may be well to ask what
the verdict of "plain, untutored men" is, even if we doubt whether
such a jury is the highest tribunal.</p>

<p>"Ask the gardener," says Berkeley, "why he thinks yonder
cherry tree exists in the garden, and he shall tell you, because he
sees it and feels it."</p>

<p>Mivart holds it one thing to see, and quite another matter to
know that we see, for he says that while we see and feel the "qualities"
of things by those "lower faculties" which we share with the
"brutes," we perceive the "substance" in which these qualities inhere,
by certain "higher faculties," which, whether represented in
the brutes by latent potencies or not, have been "given" to man in
their completeness, and not slowly and gradually built up from low
and simple beginnings in the brutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span></p>

<p>The question we are to ask the gardener is, therefore, something
to this effect: Whether he thinks the cherry tree exists because he
sees it and feels it, or because, when he sees it and feels it, he knows
that he does so?</p>

<p>If he weighs his words will he not ask how he can know that he
does see it and feel it unless he knows that he does so? I, myself, am
no philosopher; but, to my untutored mind, Mivart's distinction between
things perceived by <i>sense</i>, and things <i>perceived</i> by sense, seems
a mere verbal difference of accent and emphasis, rather than a fundamental
distinction.</p>

<p>As most men use the word, "mind" implies consciousness of that
sort which Mivart calls self-consciousness, and while there is no reason
why those who choose should not so use the word as to include unconscious
or "subconscious" or "conscientious" cerebration, most plain,
untutored men prefer to use words as their neighbors do.</p>

<p>If long waiting on Nature has given to the old gardener more
shrewdness than we commonly find in those whose pursuits are less
leisurely, he may say that, while he knows the tree is there because
he has planted it and tended it and watched it grow, it now falls on
his eyes day after day, without attracting his notice, unless something
about it which calls for his skill <i>catches</i> his eye, and <i>commands</i> his
<i>attention</i>.</p>

<p>If we see reason to believe that this difference is a matter of words
and definitions, rather than a real difference in kind; if we fail to
find any sharp dividing line between unperceived cerebration and
"mind," is not this, in itself, enough to lead even Macaulay's schoolboy
to ask whether mind may not be a slow and gradual growth from
small beginnings, and a co-ordinated whole, to the common function
of which all its parts contribute, rather than a "gift" of "lower
faculties" and "higher faculties"?</p>

<p>We must ask, however, whether mechanical explanations of mind
are in any way antagonistic to the conviction that it is a gift. May
not one study the history of the mechanism of mind, and the way
this mechanism works, in a spirit of profound and humble gratitude
to the Giver of all good gifts?</p>

<p>Is the lamentable prevalence, among plain untutored men, of
the notion that mechanical explanations of Nature are inconsistent
with belief that all Nature is a gift, to be laid to the charge of the
men of science?</p>

<p>Is it not rather the poisonous fruit of the ill-advised attempts of
"philosophers" like Professor Mivart to teach that a gift can not be
a gift at all unless it is an arbitrary interruption to the law and
order of physical Nature?</p>

<h2>THE SCIENCE OF OBSERVATION.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By CHARLES LIVY WHITTLE.</span></p>

<p>This is an era of observation; in many fields and in divers countries
the study of Nature from a strictly scientific standpoint
is being prosecuted with results which are rapidly increasing our
knowledge of the universe. This modern growth has come about as
the natural rebound of the suppressed energy that has been held
forcibly under subjugation during the last two thousand years, at a
time when the closing echoes of the warfare between the literal interpretation
of the Scriptures and science have ceased.</p>

<p>A review of this long battle with the forces of the Catholic and
Protestant churches on the one hand, arrayed against a relatively
few investigators, scattered through the last ten centuries, on the
other hand, shows a record on which none can look without regret.
As far as we are able to learn, there was little opposition to the study
of science before the collection and translation of the old manuscripts
now constituting the Alexandrian version of the Bible and the consequent
upbuilding of the Jewish church. The remains of ancient
Egyptian civilization show that science prior to that period, as
measured by the discoveries in physics and astronomy, had attained
no inconsiderable prominence; and had this people endured until
the present time, uninfluenced by the strife that for many centuries
racked the inhabitants of the eastern hemisphere, we should to-day
be far more advanced in our understanding of the universe.</p>

<p>In the more progressive countries, at least, the breaking of the
shackles in which the investigating mind had been imprisoned for so
long has led not only to a greater number of scientific workers, but
also to an increase in the fields of observation. The methods of investigation
have likewise undergone a transformation. In place of
deductive reasoning, even as late as a few decades in the past, conclusions
and generalizations are now founded on lines of thought
more largely inductive. Men of middle age are able to recall the
time when even our leading institutions of learning required instruction
in several branches of science to be given by one teacher. It
was possible twenty-five years ago for a man of great ability to
master the essentials of the leading sciences and to teach them, but
under the present stimulus for investigation no one can hope to
excel in more than one subject. It has thus come about that in place
of the many-sided teacher of science we now have in our larger universities
specialists in every subject. As the work of research progresses,
the specialist&mdash;for example, in geology&mdash;is compelled by the
increased scope of the information on his subject to select one branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
of geology of which he shall be master. The chair of geology is
now split up into economic, glacial, and mining geology, paleontology,
etc., and specialists are required in each division. This breaking up
is true of most other sciences. In this labyrinth of specialized subjects,
and the maze of technical terms rendered necessary thereby,
the people as a whole can only grope in darkness; but out of this
bewildering condition of affairs, from the mass of facts collected, and
the resulting generalizations and theories, there may be culled the
kernel of one important principle by means of which these facts are
ascertained and the generalizations made. The growth of science
and its ever-ramifying divisions, and the gradual establishment of new
methods of investigation, have brought forth what may be termed
the science of observation; and it is through an application of
the above principle that the people may be taught correctly to interpret
Nature, and, by their new habit of thought, to free the
brain from the tangle of superstition which is still present with
most of us.</p>

<p>A knowledge of how to observe natural phenomena and to draw
correct inferences therefrom has been the product of slow growth,
while through long custom, in matters closely pertaining to our daily
life, there has been observation on strictly scientific principles for
centuries. Stated succinctly, natural phenomena are due to causes,
one or more, simple or complex. These causes are the laws of the
universe, and to arrive at an understanding of them we must free our
minds of any bias and study phenomena experimentally in the laboratory,
or in our daily contact with Nature. In this way a mass of
facts will be gathered by the systematic observer which will be found
to fall into natural groups, and by inductive reasoning the laws
governing each group may be learned. It is not possible for mankind
as a whole to investigate in this exhaustive manner; but it is
important that the method of arriving at the laws of Nature be
understood. Many and, in fact, most phenomena met with in some
of the sciences, particularly those having to deal with the earth, are
susceptible of correct interpretation without attempting broad generalizations,
if the principles of scientific observation are brought to
bear upon their solution, and it is our purpose to show by practical
examples drawn from Nature how elementary students may attack
and solve some of the simple problems met with on every side. It is
proposed to use for illustration simple phenomena pertaining to the
earth, drawn from geology and its newly constituted sister science,
physical geography. These two sciences perhaps afford the greatest
range of phenomena, which are accessible to every one, in whatsoever
part of the earth he may reside. No part of the land surface is
wanting in problems which demand explanation, and which may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a><br /><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
attacked from the standpoint of the geologist or physical geographer,
or both.</p>

<p>One of the most pronounced departures taking place in preparatory-school
education at the present time is to be found in the prominence
given to these subjects, not only in the schoolroom, but by practical
experience in the laboratory of Nature, among the hills and
mountains, as well. The object of this departure is twofold: the first
and most important is to train the young early to observe phenomena
and to interpret them; the second, in a narrower sense, is purely
educational. The one inculcates a habit of thought that will be of
inestimable advantage in pursuing future study; the other, without
taking into consideration the element of mental training, constitutes
instruction in concrete things that are matters of general education.</p>

<p>Before the student in the introductory schools is brought in contact
with problems in the field, it is essential that he receive text-book
or oral instruction in some of the geological processes giving
rise to the phenomena to be studied later out of doors. In practical
teaching the student is taken on excursions into the region not far
removed from the school. At first some simple geological facts are
shown him, often on a very small scale, but embodying principles
which, when understood, lead to a ready interpretation of larger
problems. Step by step the first principles are amplified by a larger
and more varied class of examples, until the student is able logically
to apply the reasoning in explanation of simple problems to the solution
of the greater problems in physical geography and geology. In
the absence of such excursions, I shall introduce a series of photographs
carefully arranged to lead the reader along the same line of
reasoning up to similar broad conclusions&mdash;a method which, if not
so satisfactory and instructive, will at least have an educative value.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.&mdash;Quarry showing Fresh and Weathered Rocks.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Our first excursion will be to a locality where an open cut has
been made for the purpose of carrying on quarrying operations. The
accompanying photograph has been so taken as to include both the
top and the bottom of the quarry (Fig. 1). Let us first inspect the
rock in the lower part of the quarry. The existence of planes of
fracture, or joints, crossing the rock in various directions, dividing
it into blocks, early attracts our attention. The stone appears dark-colored,
tough, and is seen to be made up of two or three different
minerals: one is black, cleaves readily into thin plates of a translucent
nature, and we easily recognize it as an iron-bearing mica, or
isinglass. Another is white, and cleaves or breaks in two directions,
making angles of about ninety degrees; this we know as common
feldspar. The third is less easily recognized as pyroxene, another
of the many minerals containing iron. Having tested our knowledge
of mineralogy, we will look about and see if all the rock exposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
is like that at the bottom of the quarry. As we ascend from
the point indicated by the lower hammer, we notice that the dark
blue rock gradually takes on a rusty hue, and its toughness has become
less. Going still higher, the rusty character increases, and
along joints the rock is so lacking in coherency as to fall to pieces
when struck a light blow with a hammer. The central portions of
the blocks, however, after we have removed the outer shell of rusty
material, are seen to be like the lower rock. In the middle foreground
of the picture there are shown several bowlders derived from
above, which are merely these residual cores, and are known as
bowlders of disintegration. These are also shown in place near the
top of the picture at the extreme left. Near the top of the quarry, at
a point marked by the upper hammer, the solid rock gives place to a
rusty mass of loose material, traversing which the cracks may still be
seen, and in which there are few indications of the solid rock<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (see
Fig. 2). This loose material when carefully examined is found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
be made up of exactly the same minerals as the dense rock below,
but we notice that the mica and pyroxene are rusty and that the
feldspar is stained yellowish brown. The pyroxene in particular is
very much changed, and quickly crumbles away in the hand. It is
clear that there is every stage between the solid rock and the incoherent
powder at the surface of the ground. The joint planes crossing
the solid rock below may still be observed traversing the decayed
portion, and also many rounded areas of rock, which are seen to be
identical with the stone at the bottom of the quarry.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.&mdash;Detailed View of a Portion of Quarry showing Weathered Rock.</span></span>
</div>

<p>How shall the facts before us be explained? It has been shown
that the dense rock and the loose material are the same mineralogically,
and grade from one into the other, and it is certainly rational to
suppose that the latter is merely a changed form of the first. Some
force must have been at work on the solid rock, destroying its coherency
and converting it into loose sand. If we inspect the powdered
rock, it will become apparent that this change has been brought about
mainly by the process of weathering: surface water, with its ever-present
acid impurities, has brought about the partial decay of the
pyroxene and mica and caused the disintegration of the upper
part of the rock. Water has not only attacked the rock from the
upper surface, but has penetrated to considerable depths along the
joint planes, working inward toward the center of each block until
the mass becomes completely disintegrated. This process explains
the concentric shells about cores of unaltered rock, each representing
original joint blocks, which are seen in the second photograph. All
our excursions into the field will show that this is not an isolated
case, for wherever a ledge is exposed to our view there will be found
a zone of weathered rock, varying in thickness from mere films to
many feet.</p>

<p>By this process the greatest part of the materials constituting soils
is formed, and the flora and fauna of the earth are rendered possible.
Upon such products of decay the food supply of running water manifestly
depends in a large measure, as will be pointed out on our
next excursion; and were the scope of this article somewhat larger, it
would be easy to show that the rock decay seen in our photograph
has taken place in a length of time measured by something like ten
thousand years. If all rock decayed as easily, and if the rate of decomposition,
as determined here, held good for great distances from
the surface, mountains two miles in height would become a prey to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
the force of chemical action in six and a half million years. We
can not, however, give a time equivalent for the destruction of a
mountain range, since decay, and consequent disintegration, is only
one of the many forces acting to sap the strength of solid rocks and
to tear them asunder. The above figures are given merely to make
plain that the time necessary to accomplish the leveling of a mountain
chain is but a small part of the earth's existence as such, great
as this period may seem from the standpoint of human history.</p>

<p>We shall, if possible, time the second excursion immediately
after a heavy rain, and we shall select for our objective point a place
where the rain water, in its efforts to reach a stream, is forced to run
down some steep declivity. Under such circumstances, the carrying
power of the water will be very great, and we shall hope to find
evidence of its work in transporting the products of rock weathering
and other material broken up by the action of frost. A little
diligence will soon reward us with the evidence which we seek.
A local inequality of the ground, perhaps only a few feet across, is
found filled with water&mdash;a minute, temporary lake caused by the
recent heavy rainfall. Such little water bodies are extremely common,
but the accompanying geological phenomena are, notwithstanding,
none the less interesting, and the conclusions to be drawn from
the evidence thus presented are none the less valuable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p>If we examine the pool critically, it will be noticed that its shore
line is cut by a little channel along which the overflow makes its
escape. Further investigation will show that at another point along
the shore, especially if we are fortunate enough to visit the locality
very soon after a rain, there is a small rivulet entering the pool; and
also that the entering stream is discolored with mud and carries more
or less sand, while the escaping stream is nearly clear, and is free
from all traces of coarse, sandy material. It is therefore evident
that the sediment brought in by the stream has been left behind in
the pool, and of course will be found deposited at its bottom, and
it will appear that the only explanation of the inability of the water
further to transport its burden is to be found in the fact that water
loses nearly all its motion, and therefore its transporting power, on
entering a stagnant pool. These are elementary truths, but an
amplification of such simple phenomena is often fully capable of
accounting for the most stupendous results.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illo_035_fig3.jpg" width="500" height="385" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.&mdash;Temporary Wet-weather Delta.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Having made these observations, let us look at the form assumed
by the sediment when it is forced to fall to the bottom. At the point
where the stream enters the pool there is seen an accumulation of
material having a nearly level upper surface, presenting a scalloped
or lobe-shaped outer margin, upon which the stream may be seen
flowing and entering the water at one of the lobes. Other channels,
though unoccupied by water, also lead to similar lobes. If we watch
closely, we may be able to witness the growth of this body of sand,
called a delta, as the falling sediment rapidly increases the size of the
lobe; and also to perceive that as soon as the lobe is built out considerably
in advance of the main body of sand, it will be easier for
the stream to enter the water on one side of the scallop, thus abandoning
its old mouth. In this manner the stream moves from one
place to another, successively building the little scallops and continually
carving new channels for itself. Fig. 3 is a photograph of
such a delta, some three feet across, taken after the water had been
drained away, and reveals its form in a characteristic manner. As
we watch its growth, it will become evident that only the coarsest
material transported by the stream goes to make up the delta, and
that the clay and finest sand are deposited farther away, where the
water is more quiet, or else pass out in the stream draining the pool.
Let us look about a little. Not far from our miniature lake there are
several others. In some the size of the delta is much larger in proportion
to the area of the pool than is the case with the one first
studied. We find in some cases that the stream has progressively
built its delta completely across the old water surface. Taking a thin
piece of board or a large knife, we can easily cut vertically through
this sand deposit, thus exposing what is called a geological section.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
The sand grains of which the deposit is largely composed are seen
to be arranged in layers nearly horizontal, and these layers are found
to be due to alternations of sediment varying in fineness. This
phenomenon is called stratification, and is what we should expect of
the action of gravity operating on material of different sizes and
densities suspended in a body of water. It has been found inexpedient
to attempt to show a photograph of this section, owing to the
smallness of the subject, but the same phenomena may be observed
on a much larger scale in Fig. 5, which will be described below.</p>

<p>A few rods away the stream that feeds the pool has its origin.
The sediment carried by the water and going to build up its delta
has its source in part in a neighboring bank made up of material
derived from solid rock by weathering, similar to that shown on our
first excursion, and partly from older water deposits. Steep channels
exist in the disintegrated rock, which represent the material removed
by the fast-flowing rain water.</p>

<p>Now what geological phenomena have we observed at this locality?
In the first place, it has become clear that running water possesses
the power of transporting sediment. In the second place, this
sediment has been deposited wherever the velocity of the water has
been materially checked. The sediment has been laid down in horizontal
layers under the influence of gravity. Furthermore, the material
of which the delta is composed has been shown, in part at least,
to have been derived from a solid rock such as forms our mountains.
In our first excursion we saw that chemical change promoted disintegration;
in our second, running water is observed seizing upon
these products of decay, transporting them and building them into
stratified deposits in the first convenient pool. A level-topped delta
is first formed, which may or may not grow to fill the pool in which
it is born. Some of the pools have become filled, while the delta
as such has disappeared; it has grown into a tiny sand plain.</p>

<p>Let us see if the work performed by these temporary rivulets is
typical of running water in general. For this purpose we shall visit
a spot where a river enters some considerable body of water such as a
lake. Let us inspect the river. Its water is sluggish, discolored by
organic matter derived from decaying vegetation, and for some distance
up stream from its mouth it meanders slowly across a flat,
marshy area or meadow. If we also visit the spot at a time when the
river is swollen by heavy rains or melting snows, the presence of this
organic matter will be masked by the turbidity of the water; we shall
learn that only in the freshet seasons does the water attain sufficient
velocity to carry any visible load of sand and clay. The upper end
of the lake will be found to be shallow, muddy, and water lilies
will have discovered congenial surroundings. At another part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
the lake the outflowing water appears clear as crystal; the sediment
brought in by the river has manifestly been deposited in the lake,
as was the case in our little pool. The marsh at the upper end, of
course, is merely another delta, slow growing in this instance, grass-covered,
but as surely encroaching on the water area as in the earlier
examples. When an entering stream is normally of great transporting
power, owing to steep slopes down which it rushes, the form of
its delta is not unlike the one first described.</p>

<p>With the data already gathered, we can not escape from the conclusion
that the growth going on at the head of the lake will in time,
if present conditions continue to exist, push its way forward until it
has occupied the whole water area. The sediment which is now deposited
therein will then be transported across the plain, and will
be carried along until another body of water is reached. Further
search will bring to light the fact that there are plenty of examples
showing all stages between the simple delta and the completely filled
lake. The innumerable marshes and meadows which characterize
the northern part of the United States are fine examples of lakes
which have perished in this manner.</p>

</div>

<p>Our next excursion will be made to the locality shown in Fig. 4,
which is a sketch of a large delta occurring at a considerable
height above the general level of the country, although at the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
time the delta is not in vicinity of water.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It will be evident to the
reader that it differs in no important particular, excepting size,
from our little type specimen formed in a pool. Its level top and
frontal lobes are to-day nearly as strongly marked as at the time it
was made. The reader will have little difficulty in picturing the
original conditions of its formation in some ancient lake. This old
lake did not endure until the inflowing streams had filled it to a
level plain, but for some reason, which it is unnecessary for us to
consider, the water was permitted to escape, leaving the delta perched
on the valley side. Such deltas are very common, and we find them
in all stages, from simple beginnings, as above, to the completed sand
plain.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.&mdash;Geological Cross-section of a Delta.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The sand of which our first delta was composed has already been
referred to as arranged in horizontal layers. In order to verify our
conclusions regarding the origin of this delta, let us seek for an opportunity
to observe its internal structure, and to compare it with
that observed in the first example. It may happen that the opportunity
does not exist at this immediate locality, but a little way off a similar
deposit occurs, and a beautiful section has been uncovered by the
vigorous attacks of a steam shovel. This section has already been referred
to on page <a href="#Page_464">464</a>, as illustrating the structure of the sand layers
making up the tiny delta, as well as water deposits in general, and is
reproduced here as Fig. 5. The reader will observe in this picture
many familiar features common to railroad excavations. The upper
part of the geological section thus exposed is somewhat masked by a
downfall of sand and loam, and the lower part is also hidden by the
same materials. Along the central part, however, the sand and gravel
may be seen arranged in horizontal layers of a varying thickness. A
close inspection of the uppermost layers will detect a variation in
coarseness among the different strata. Such alternations of layers of
coarse and fine material are due to differences in the transporting power
of the running water that brought the sand and pebbles to their present
resting place; the coarse gravel and pebbles were carried by fast-flowing
rivers, and the fine sand by streams of less rapidity and consequently
less transporting power. Beds of this character ordinarily
correspond closely in time with alternating periods of great rainfall
or snow melting and the summer seasons. The pebbles of which the
coarse layers are composed, as we should expect, are far from spherical,
and the operation of gravity on such bodies, as they fall to the
floor of a lake or ocean, is to cause them to arrange themselves with
their flat surfaces horizontal and parallel to one another. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a><br /><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
example before us this fact is apparent, and affords the basis for another
line of reasoning by which all such stratified deposits, however
great their magnitude, are to be referred to the same source&mdash;namely,
stream-transported materials derived from a decaying and wasting
land surface, laid down in water under the influence of gravity.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at a most important and far-reaching generalization
so far as the work performed by running water is concerned,
and its action in filling our lakes and ponds; and we have
learned by observation on a small scale the means by which such
deposits may be recognized. Let us apply these means of recognition
to the phenomena shown by our large rivers and the more enduring
oceans into which they drain. In the same manner that we have
studied the little pool and larger lake, we will look into the work
done by the great waterways of our continents, selecting as a type of
such streams the mighty Mississippi. Careful measurement has
shown that this river annually transports two hundred million tons
of sediment mechanically suspended. What becomes of this enormous
quantity of sand and clay, equal to a cubic mile in a little over a
century, as it is swept into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico? For
this purpose we have only to visit the region about its mouth to
become acquainted with the almost impotent struggles that have been
made by our Government during the last fifty years in an effort to
keep the river below New Orleans, in part at least, confined to its
present channels; and to study the chart of that portion of the Gulf
coast prepared by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (see
Fig. 6). We have not forgotten the little lobes; their method
of growth, and the general form of our first-seen delta, shown
in Fig. 3. In viewing the phenomena at the mouth of the Mississippi,
it is no longer necessary for our present purposes to make a
detailed study, since it will become apparent at once that the river is
doing the work on a larger scale typified by the performance of the
tiny stream flowing into its temporary pool. In place of the little
delta with its still smaller lobes, the Mississippi has deposited at its
mouth an enormous delta, thousands of square miles in area, and its
bifurcating arms may be seen building out several scallops for miles
into the waters of the gulf. For centuries these long lobes have been
building in advance of the delta front. The arms gradually become
clogged with sediment, a new passage to the ocean is opened on the
sides, where deposition will begin at a new point, producing a lobe as
before. Situated many miles up the river, it is to-day the great fear
of New Orleans that its only navigable arm to the sea will thus be
closed to that commerce upon which the life of the city depends.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illo_042_fig6.jpg" width="500" height="360" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.&mdash;The Delta of the Mississippi.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Only a portion of the sediment brought in by the river goes to
form its delta; a large part of the finest material, such as clay, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
transported by temporary and permanent currents thousands of miles
away, where it is deposited in the more quiet waters of the ocean. In
this manner the Mississippi has been shown to deposit a cubic mile
of mechanically transported material in a little over a century. What
shall we say of the effects produced on the continents and oceans by
thousands of rivers, each doing its proportionate share of work and
acting through millions of years? Two main results must follow,
unless interruptions occur: the lower elevations and the magnificent
mountain ranges, which rear their lofty heads above the permanent
snow line, will be divided into minor peaks; valleys will be carved
out; the whole land surface will slowly waste away, at first rapidly,
at last slowly, and be transported to the oceans, where it will form
great horizontal beds differing in no essential particular, excepting
size, from those shown in Fig. 5&mdash;great deposits that are merely
deltas on a large scale. The geologist, however, finds no evidence to
indicate that at any time in the earth's history have these theoretical
results taken place. Land masses, of continental dimensions, have
not been allowed thus to waste entirely away to a general flatness
on account of the interruptions caused by elevation&mdash;the bodily
lifting of great areas of rock, even out of the ocean floor, to become
mountains or plateaus, in some cases higher than any point in this
country. If our observations thus far and those yet to be made serve
to make this clear, one of the objects of this article will have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
accomplished. It is to be hoped that our observations have made
plain the processes of rock disintegration and water transportation;
that in the oceans all these materials are eventually deposited in beds
horizontally arranged, composed of such products of decay in the
condition of sand and mud. We have only to point out the proof
that great land masses, composed of water-deposited materials, have
been lifted from the ocean to become continents and mountain ranges.</p>

<p>As the ocean deposits slowly accumulate in layers to beds of
many thousands of feet in thickness, the lower parts are gradually
subjected to greatly increased pressure produced by the overlying
beds. During this time waters of a varying temperature, carrying,
chemically dissolved, great quantities of lime, silica, and iron oxide,
are allowed free circulation through them. These conditions promote
chemical change: much silica (the mineral quartz), lesser amounts
of carbonate of lime (the mineral calcite), and iron oxide are precipitated
about the loose sand grains, firmly cementing them together into
a solid rock. A cycle has thus been completed; the dense rocks
composing a continent have passed by the process of weathering into
incoherent sand and clay, which, when transported to the ocean
floor, become again converted into solid rock.</p>

<p>Historical records prove that during the last three thousand years
there have taken place many changes in the ocean's level. Old islands
have disappeared; new ones have emerged above the surface of the
water. Great stretches of seacoast exist at the present time which
within the historical period have been covered by the ocean. Even
at the present writing we are witnessing the gradual submergence of
some parts of the earth and the rising of others; terraces on the northern
Atlantic coast may be seen along the hillsides many feet above
the present level of the ocean&mdash;all of which go to show that the relationship
of the land to the water is an unstable one. These are the
evidences of continental growth and depressions from the historical
standpoint, and the validity of the data upon which the belief is
founded can not be shaken. The evidence from the geological side is
overwhelming, but before we speak of this it will be well once more
to say a word as to the causes of continental uplift.</p>

<p>From an original fluid globe possessing a high temperature, the
earth has now cooled down to a degree sufficiently low to permit the
formation of a thick rock crust. Underneath this crust an approach
to the old surface temperatures is still maintained, and the existence
of a certain degree of fluidity is demonstrated to us from time to
time by the phenomenon of volcanism. Successive zones of cooling
took place. The outer part could only conform to a shrinking interior
by wrinkling, folding, or bodily lifting considerable areas above the
general level. An adjustment of strains thus set up would take place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
either with or without folding of the strata. These initial wrinkles
gave rise to our first mountains, and the continuation of these conditions
at the present time is as surely nourishing mountain growth
as at any time in the past. In this way the fluctuations of the ocean's
level, above referred to, alone are to be explained, and such form
but temporary rises and falls in the history of a continent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.&mdash;Mountain showing Rock Folding.</span></span>
</div>

<p>The rate at which an ocean bed is raised to form a mountain
range is, no doubt, a variable one; always slow, often interrupted, but
seldom or never violent. During this time the strata usually undergo
crushing and folding; stretching takes place, and displacements of the
rocks, or faulting, are not uncommon. As an example of the wrinkling
that the strata may suffer under these conditions, the reader is
referred to the beautiful symmetrical fold shown on the side of a
mountain in the Appalachians (Fig. 7). Similar folding is the
rule, but often immense areas are raised to great heights above the
ocean without disturbing the horizontal position of the beds (see Fig.
8). Coincident with the emergence of the rocks from beneath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
water, there begin the attacks of the forces operating to destroy them.
Hand in hand there go on growth and destruction. The two may
keep an even pace; either may obtain the mastery. In the one case,
lack of considerable elevation and flatness result; in the other, great
altitudes may be attained. The rivers may cut their valleys downward
as fast as the land rises, or the down-cutting may be relatively
slower. In any case, after a given land mass has attained its greatest
height above the sea, the larger rivers soon cut their channels down
as far as river cutting is possible&mdash;namely, to within a few feet of
sea level. With relatively rapid elevation, soft rocks, and large

6. The points of resemblance between the two sections exposed,
one by a steam shovel, the other by river action, are the horizontal
position of the strata and the alternations of beds of unlike character.
The differences are mainly that the beds making up the mountain
show that they are built up of alternating layers of sand (now converted
into a sandstone) and clay (now in the condition of a slate).
Are not these the products of a decayed continent? Is their position
to be explained otherwise than along the lines already stated? Our
only difficulty in readily accepting this conclusion is founded on a
hereditary belief, born in ignorance and nourished to maturity by
superstition, that the earth came into existence as we see it to-day, the
surface dissected by valleys in which the rivers find established
courses to the sea; possessing a multiplicity of highland and lowland,
granite mountains and marble hills, as a result of some plan carried
into effect as a creative act. Science has revealed the impossibility
of this interpretation. Considered in the light of evolution, acting
through an immense period of time, by means of the processes
already enumerated, the diversity of land form is made plain to us,
and the ever-varying characters of rock structure and composition are
in the main made easy of comprehension. Viewed in the light of the
foregoing pages, and illustrating as they do land form and the greater
part of the earth's crust, the rock structures revealed on the sides of
the mountains and ca&ntilde;ons, as well as the broader valley itself, take
on a new and more intelligent interest. High and enduring as the
mountains may appear, resistant as their solid rocks may seem, they
are doomed as mountains to the same fate that their own structure
and composition prove to have overtaken earlier mountains before
them.</p>

<p>The earth has known no cessation in this cycle of decay, deposition,
and elevation; again and again have continental masses been
raised from the ocean floor only to become a prey to the forces that
destroy them. These cycles will continue&mdash;mountain ranges will fade
away and new ones will be born. A more permanent relationship
between the lowland, the upland, and the ocean level will never be
attained until the forces that warp and wrinkle the earth's crust shall
have ceased forever.</p>

heated, but not enough to make the other end too hot to be held in the
hand, and then suddenly cooled, the temperature of the other end will rise
till the hand can not bear it. All workmen who have occasion to handle

<h2>DEATH GULCH, A NATURAL BEAR-TRAP.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By T.A. Jaggar, Jr., Ph.D.</span></p>


<p>Cases of asphyxiation by gas have been very frequently reported
of late years, and we commonly associate with such reports the
idea of a second-rate hotel and an unsophisticated countryman who
blows out the gas. Such incidents we connect with the supercivilization
of the nineteenth century, but it is none the less true that Nature
furnishes similar accidents, and that in regions far remote from
the haunts of men. In the heart of the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming,
unknown to either the tourist or the trapper, there is a natural
hostelry for the wild inhabitants of the forest, where, with food,
drink, and shelter all in sight, the poor creatures are tempted one
after another into a bath of invisible poisonous vapor, where they
sink down to add their bones to the fossil records of an interminable
list of similar tragedies, dating back to a period long preceding the
records of human history.</p>

<p>It was the writer's privilege, as a member of the expedition of
the United States Geological Survey of the Yellowstone Park, under
the direction of Mr. Arnold Hague, to visit and for the first time
to photograph this remarkable locality. A similar visit was last
made by members of the survey in the summer of 1888, and an
account of the discovery of Death Gulch was published in Science
(February 15, 1889) under the title A Deadly Gas Spring in the
Yellowstone Park, by Mr. Walter Harvey Weed. The following
extracts from Mr. Weed's paper indicate concisely the general character
of the gulch, and the description of the death-trap as it then
appeared offers interesting material for comparison with its condition
as observed in the summer of 1897.</p>

<p>Death Gulch is a small and gloomy ravine in the northeast corner
of the Yellowstone National Park. "In this region the lavas which
fill the ancient basin of the park rest upon the flanks of mountains
formed of fragmentary volcanic ejecta, ... while the hydrothermal
forces of the central portion of the park show but feeble manifestations
of their energy in the almost extinct hot-spring areas
of Soda Butte, Lamar River, Cache Creek, and Miller Creek."
Although hot water no longer flows from these vents, "gaseous
emanations are now given off in considerable volume." On Cache
Creek, about two miles above its confluence with Lamar River, are
deposits of altered and crystalline travertine, with pools in the creek
violently effervescing locally. This is due to the copious emission of
gas. Above these deposits "the creek cuts into a bank of sulphur
and gravel cemented by this material, and a few yards beyond is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
<i>d&eacute;bouchure</i> of a small lateral gully coming down from the mountainside.
In its bottom is a small stream of clear and cold water,
sour with sulphuric acid, and flowing down a narrow and steep channel
cut in beds of dark-gray volcanic tuff. Ascending this gulch,
the sides, closing together, become very steep slopes of white, decomposed
rock.... The only springs now flowing are small oozes
of water issuing from the base of these slopes, or from the channel
bed, forming a thick, creamy, white deposit about the vents, and
covering the stream bed. This deposit consists largely of sulphate
of alumina.... About one hundred and fifty feet above the main
stream these oozing springs of acid water cease, but the character of
the gulch remains the same. The odor of sulphur now becomes
stronger, though producing no other effect than a slight irritation of
the lungs.</p>

<p>"The gulch ends, or rather begins, in a scoop or basin about
two hundred and fifty feet above Cache Creek, and just below this
was found the fresh body of a large bear, a silver-tip grizzly, with
the remains of a companion in an advanced stage of decomposition
above him. Near by were the skeletons of four more bears, with the
bones of an elk a yard or two above, while in the bottom of the
pocket were the fresh remains of several squirrels, rock hares, and
other small animals, besides numerous dead butterflies and insects.
The body of the grizzly was carefully examined for bullet holes or
other marks of injury, but showed no traces of violence, the only indication
being a few drops of blood under the nose. It was evident
that he had met his death but a short time before, as the carcass was
still perfectly fresh, though offensive enough at the time of a later
visit. The remains of a cinnamon bear just above and alongside of
this were in an advanced state of decomposition, while the other skeletons
were almost denuded of flesh, though the claws and much of the
hair remained. It was apparent that these animals, as well as the
squirrels and insects, had not met their death by violence, but had
been asphyxiated by the irrespirable gas given off in the gulch. The
hollows were tested for carbonic-acid gas with lighted tapers without
proving its presence, but the strong smell of sulphur, and a choking
sensation of the lungs, indicated the presence of noxious gases, while
the strong wind prevailing at the time, together with the open nature
of the ravine, must have caused a rapid diffusion of the vapors.</p>

<p>"This place differs, therefore, very materially from the famous
Death Valley of Java and similar places, in being simply a V-shaped
trench, not over seventy-five feet deep, cut in the mountain slope,
and not a hollow or cave. That the gas at times accumulates in the
pocket at the head of the gulch is, however, proved by the dead
squirrels, etc., found on its bottom. It is not probable, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
that the gas ever accumulates here to a considerable depth, owing
to the open nature of the place, and the fact that the gulch draining
it would carry off the gas, which would, from its density, tend to
flow down the ravine. This offers an explanation of the death of the
bears, whose remains occur not in this basin, but where it narrows
to form the ravine, for it is here that the layer of gas would be
deepest, and has proved sufficient to suffocate the first bear, who
was probably attracted by the remains of the elk, or perhaps of the
smaller victims of the invisible gas; and he, in turn, has doubtless
served as bait for others who have in turn succumbed. Though the
gulch has doubtless served as a death-trap for a very long period of
time, these skeletons and bodies must be the remains of only the most
recent victims, for the ravine is so narrow and the fall so great that
the channel must be cleared out every few years, if not annually.
The change wrought by the water during a single rainstorm, which
occurred in the interval between Mr. Weed's first and second visits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
was so considerable that it seems probable that the floods of early
spring, when the snows are melting under the hot sun of this region,
must be powerful enough to wash everything down to the cone of
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> at the mouth of the gulch." Mr. Arnold Hague, on the occasion
of his visit, was more successful in obtaining evidence of the
presence of carbonic-dioxide gas. He writes: "The day I went up
the ravine I was able in two places to extinguish a long brown paper
taper. The day I was there it was very calm, and where I made the
test the water was trickling down a narrow gorge shut in by shelving
rocks above."</p>

<p>It was at noon on the 22d of July in the summer of 1897 that
we made camp near the mouth of Cache Creek, about three miles
southeast of the military post and mail station of Soda Butte. In
company with Dr. Francis P. King I at once started up the creek,
keeping the left bank, that we might not miss the gulch, which joins
the valley of Cache Creek from the southern side. We had a toilsome
climb through timber and over steep embankments, cut by the
creek in a loose conglomerate, and after going about a mile and a
half we noticed that some of these banks were stained with whitish
and yellow deposits of alum and sulphur, indicating that we were
nearing the old hot-spring district. Soon a caved-in cone of travertine
was seen, with crystalline calcite and sulphur in the cavities, and
the bed of the creek was more or less completely whitened by these
deposits, while here and there could be seen along the banks oozing
"paint-pots" of calcareous mud, in one case inky black, with deposits
of varicolored salts about its rim, and a steady ebullition of
gas bubbles rising from the bottom. In other cases these pools were
crystal clear, and always cold. The vegetation, which below had
been dense close to the creek's bank, here became more scanty, especially
on the southern side, where the bare rock was exposed and
seen to be a volcanic breccia, much decomposed and stained with solfataric
deposits. A mound of coarse <i>d&eacute;bris</i> seen just above on this
side indicated the presence of a lateral ravine, which from its situation
and character we decided was probably the gulch sought for. A
strong odor of sulphureted hydrogen had been perceptible for some
time, and when we entered the gully the fumes became oppressive,
causing a heavy burning sensation in the throat and lungs. The
ravine proved to be as described, a V-shaped trench cut in the volcanic
rock, about fifty feet in depth, with very steep bare whitish
slopes, narrowing to a stony rill bed that ascended steeply back into
the mountain side.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">General View, looking downstream, of Lower Part of Death Gulch.</span></span>
</div>

<p>Climbing through this trough, a frightfully weird and dismal
place, utterly without life, and occupied by only a tiny streamlet and
an appalling odor, we at length discovered some brown furry masses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
lying scattered about the floor of the ravine about a quarter of a
mile from the point where we had left Cache Creek. Approaching
cautiously, it became quickly evident that we had before us a large
group of huge recumbent bears; the one nearest to us was lying with
his nose between his paws, facing us, and so exactly like a huge
dog asleep that it did not seem possible that it was the sleep of
death. To make sure, I threw a pebble at the animal, striking
him on the flank; the distended skin resounded like a drumhead,
and the only response was a belch of poisonous gas that almost overwhelmed
us. Closer examination showed that the animal was a
young silver-tip grizzly (<i>Ursus horribilis</i>); a few drops of thick,
dark-red blood stained his nostrils and the ground beneath. There
proved to be five other carcasses, all bears, in various stages of decay;
careful search revealed oval areas of hair and bones that represented
two other bears, making a total of eight carcasses in all. Seven were
grizzlies, one was a cinnamon bear (<i>Ursus americanus</i>). One huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
grizzly was so recent a victim that his tracks were still visible in the
white, earthy slopes, leading down to the spot where he had met his
death. In no case were any marks of violence seen, and there can
be no question that death was occasioned by the gas. The wind was
blowing directly up the ravine during our visit, and we failed to
get any test for carbonic acid, though we exhausted all our matches
in the effort, plunging the flames into hollows of the rill bed in various
parts of its course; they invariably burned brightly, and showed
not the slightest tendency to extinguish. The dilution of the gas in
such a breeze would be inevitable, however; that the gas was present
was attested by the peculiar oppression on the lungs that was felt
during the entire period that we were in the gulch, and which only
wore off gradually on our return to camp. I suffered from a slight
headache in consequence for several hours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illo_052_looking.jpg" width="500" height="496" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Looking down the Gulch&mdash;the Latest Victim, a Large Silver-Tip Grizzly.</span></span>
</div>

<p>There was no difference in the appearance of the portion of the
gulch where the eight bears had met their end and the region above
and below. A hundred yards or more up stream the solfataric deposits
become less abundant, and the timber grows close to the brook;
a short distance beyond this the gulch ends. No bodies were found
above, and only bears were found in the locality described. It will
be observed that Weed's experience differs in this respect from ours,
and the appearance of the place was somewhat different: he found elk
and small animals in addition to the bears, and describes the death-trap
as occupying the mouth of the basin at the head of the gulch,
above the point where the last springs of acid water cease. The
rill observed by us has its source far above the animals; indeed, it
trickles directly through the worm-eaten carcass of the cinnamon
bear&mdash;a thought by no means comforting when we realized that the
water supply for our camp was drawn from the creek only a short
distance down the valley.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that there may be two or three of these
gullies having similar properties. That we should have found only
bears may perhaps be accounted for on the ground that the first
victim for this season was a bear, and his carcass frightened away
all animals except those of his own family. For an illustration of a
process of accumulation of the bones of large vertebrates, with all
the conditions present necessary for fossilization, no finer example
can be found in the world than Death Gulch; year after year the
snow slides and spring floods wash down this fresh supply of entrapped
carcasses to be buried in the waste cones and alluvial bottoms
of Cache Creek and Lamar River. Probably the stream-formed
conglomerate that we noted as we ascended the creek is locally filled
with these remains.</p>

<p>The gas is probably generated by the action of the acid water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
on the ancient limestones that here underlie the lavas at no great
depth; outcrops of these limestones occur only a few miles away at
the mouth of Soda Butte Creek. This gas must emanate from fissures
in the rock just above the bears, and on still nights it may accumulate
to a depth of two or three feet in the ravine, settling in a
heavy, wavy stratum, and probably rolling slowly down the bed of
the rill into the valley below. The accompanying photographs were
made during our visit.</p>

<h2>THE LABOR PROBLEM IN THE TROPICS.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By W. ALLEYNE IRELAND.</span></p>


<p>A great deal of space has been devoted in American magazines
and newspapers recently to the question of how this country
has become a colonial power. Destiny and duty, strength and weakness,
accident and design, honesty and corruption have been called
on by writers, singly and in various combinations, to bear the responsibility
of the new departure in the national policy.</p>

<p>Whatever interest such speculations may possess for the student
who seeks to discover in the events of history some indication of the
evolution of national character, there can be little doubt that the
eyes of the people at large are turned in another direction.</p>

<p>What are our new possessions worth? is the question which intelligent
men of all classes are beginning to ask; and it is not surprising,
in view of the comparative isolation of this country in the
past, that there are few who have sufficient confidence in their own
opinion to answer the query.</p>

<p>In England, whose colonial and Indian empire embraces nearly
one fourth of the population of the globe, there is an astounding
lack of knowledge in relation to colonial affairs; and those who
follow the debates in the House of Commons will have noticed that
when the colonies are the subject under discussion the few members
who remain in their seats seldom fail to exhibit a degree of ignorance
which must be most disheartening to the able and learned Colonial
Secretary.</p>

<p>It is not to be wondered at, then, that in the United States, where
the people have been too much occupied with the problems continually
arising at home to pay any attention to affairs which, until very recently,
have appeared entirely outside the range of practical politics,
there should be few men who have given their time to that careful
study of tropical colonization which alone can impart any value to
opinions in regard to the practical issues involved in the colonial expansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
of this country. Discussion of the subject has been almost
entirely along the line of the possible effects of the new policy on the
political institutions and popular ideals of the United States, and
little has been written which may be said to throw any light on the
problem of tropical colonization <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p>A residence of ten years in the tropical colonies of France, Spain,
Holland, and Great Britain&mdash;a period during which I devoted much
time to the study of colonial affairs&mdash;leaves me of opinion that there
are two points in regard to which discussion is peculiarly opportune:
1. The value of the Philippines and Puerto Rico as a field for the
cultivation of those tropical products which are consumed in the
temperate zones. 2. The value of the islands as a market for products
and manufactures of the temperate zones.</p>

<p>It will at once be seen that only in so far as the islands are
valuable in the former respect can they be important in the latter,
for in the absence of production there can not be any considerable
consumption of commodities.</p>

<p>The first point to be considered, and it is the one to which I shall
confine myself in the present article, is by what means the productive
possibilities of Puerto Rico and the Philippines can be developed.</p>

<p>Basing my calculation on official reports covering a number of
years, I find that the average value <i>per capita</i> of the annual exports
of native products from a number of tropical colonies selected by me
for the purpose of this inquiry is as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="average per capita">
<tr><td align="left">Trinidad</td><td align="right">$26.48</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Dominica</td><td align="right">$7.28</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">British Guiana</td><td align="right">34.26</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="left">St. Vincent</td><td align="right">7.68</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Martinique</td><td align="right">23.48</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Ceylon</td><td align="right">7.24</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Mauritius</td><td align="right">20.28</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="left">Montserrat</td><td align="right">7.89</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>An examination of these figures will serve to show that the value
of the colonies in the first column, measured by the standard of their
productiveness, is three times that of the colonies in the second column.
Reference to the population returns of the colonies named
discloses the fact that in the colonies in the first column the population
contains a very large proportion of imported contract laborers
and their descendants, while in the other colonies practically the
whole population is home-born for at least two generations.</p>

<p>A moment's reflection will show the importance of the comparison
instituted above, and if the space at my command permitted a more
extensive analysis of the trade of tropical colonies, it could be demonstrated
that the theory holds good, almost without exception, that of
tropical countries those only are commercially valuable in which a
system of imported contract labor is in force.</p>

<p>There are one or two colonies (Barbados is the most striking example)
in which the pressure of population is so great that the labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
supply suffices for the utmost development of which the country is
capable; but such instances are rare.</p>

<p>The experience of England in governing tropical colonies is frequently
cited by those who favor the so-called imperial policy for the
United States as a proof that tropical colonization in itself presents no
difficulties which can not be overcome by enlightened administration.
It would be difficult to point out in just what manner Great Britain
derives any benefit from her tropical possessions, but her experience
confirms the theory I have stated above&mdash;that the commercial development
of tropical colonies is possible only where there is an extraordinary
density of population or where a system of imported contract
labor is in force.</p>

<p>A glance through the list of Great Britain's tropical colonies will
serve to prove the correctness of this theory. Imported contract
labor is used in British Guiana, Trinidad, Jamaica, Queensland,
the Fiji Islands, the Straits Settlements, and Mauritius; while the
pressure of population is extreme in Lagos and Barbados, which support
respectively 1,333 and 1,120 persons to the square mile.</p>

<p>The remaining tropical colonies of Great Britain&mdash;using the term
"tropical colony" in its strictest sense&mdash;are the Gold Coast, Sierra
Leone, Gambia, Hongkong, St. Helena, British Honduras, Grenada,
St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Antigua, St. Kitts-Nevis, Dominica, Montserrat,
and a few islands in the Pacific which are insignificant commercially.</p>

<p>A careful examination of the British trade returns shows that the
total export and import trade between the United Kingdom and all
the British tropical colonies in 1896 reached a value of $146,000,000,
and that of this sum $121,000,000 represented trade with the tropical
colonies which employ imported contract labor and with Lagos and
Barbados. In other words, the trade between the United Kingdom
and those British tropical colonies where free labor is used and where
there is no great pressure of population made up less than eighteen
per cent of the total trade with the British tropical colonies.</p>

<p>It would appear from the facts I have given that the commercial
development of those parts of the tropics where the population is
sparse will be dependent on the importation of labor from more
densely peopled areas.</p>

<p>If the question is approached from an entirely different standpoint
the necessity of contract labor in the tropics becomes more strikingly
apparent. The development of the tropics will be in the direction
of agriculture rather than manufacturing, and the requirements
of tropical agriculture in respect of labor are most arbitrary. It is
not sufficient that the labor supply is ample, in the ordinary sense of
the word; it must be at all times immediately available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, a mine owner whose men go out on strike is, briefly, placed
in this position: He will lose a sum of money somewhat larger than
the amount of profit he could have made during the period of the
strike had it not occurred. His coal, however, is still there, and is
not less valuable&mdash;indeed, in the case of a prolonged strike, may
actually be more valuable&mdash;when the strike is over; work can easily
be resumed where it was dropped, and during the idle days the ordinary
running expenses of the mine cease. The greater part of the
loss sustained in the instance I have supposed is not out-of-pocket loss,
but merely the failure to realize prospective profits.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a sugar estate in the tropics spends about eight
months out of the twelve in cultivating the crop, and the remaining
four in reaping and boiling operations. By the time the crop is ready
to reap many thousands of dollars have been expended on it by way
of planting, weeding, draining, and the application of nitrogenous
manures. If from any cause the labor supply fails when the cutting
of the canes is about to commence, every cent expended on the crop
is wasted; and if for want of labor the canes which are cut are not
transported within a few hours to the mills, they turn sour and
can not be made into sugar. It will thus be seen that in the case of
sugar-growing a perfectly reliable labor supply is the first requisite.</p>

<p>The same might be said of the cultivation of tea, coffee, cocoa,
spices, and tropical fruits.</p>

<p>This problem&mdash;the securing of a reliable labor supply&mdash;has been
solved in the case of several of the tropical possessions of England
by the importation of East Indian laborers under contract to serve
for a fixed period on the plantations.</p>

<p>As, in my opinion, the East Indian contract laborer will play an
important part in the development of the tropics, I describe in detail
the most perfect system of contract labor with which I am acquainted,
that existing at the present time in the colony of British
Guiana. The system of imported indentured labor which is in force
in many of the British colonies has been referred to frequently, both
in this country and in England, as "slavery," "semislavery," "the new
slavery." The use of such terms to describe such a system indicates
a complete ignorance of the facts. As some of the best-informed
journals in this country, in noticing my writings on tropical subjects,
have fallen into this error, I hope that the description I give here,
which is based on several years' experience of the actual working
of the system, will serve to convince the readers of this article that
the indenture of the East Indian coolie in the British colonies is no
more a form of slavery than is any contract entered into between an

Government in 1834 that four years later slavery would be entirely
abolished throughout the British Empire, he foresaw at once that
unless a new source of labor was thrown open a very short time would
elapse before the cane fields would fall out of cultivation. He listened,
not without some irritation, to the assurances of the agents of
the Antislavery Society that as soon as the slaves were freed they
would work with redoubled energy, and that the labor supply, instead
of deteriorating, would, in fact, improve. The planters knew
better, and began at once to arrange for the importation of contract
labor. With the year 1834 began the period of apprenticeship for
the slaves, prior to their complete emancipation four years later.</p>

<p>During this time, and before the imported labor sufficed for the
needs of the plantations, several estates were ruined and fell out of
cultivation because the apprenticed laborers would not work.</p>

<p>On October 11, 1838, the governor of the colony, Henry Light,
Esquire, issued a proclamation to the freed slaves. The proclamation
stated that the governor had learned with regret that the labor of
the freed slaves was irregular; that their masters could not depend on
them; that they worked one day and idled the next; that when they
had earned enough to fill their bellies they lay down to sleep or
idled away their time; that they left their tasks unfinished, and then
expected to be paid in full for them.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the planters imported labor from the West
Indian Islands, Malta, Madeira, China, and Germany; and eventually
the system of immigration from India was organized.</p>

<p>The system is under the control of the Indian Council in Calcutta
on the one hand and the British Guiana Government and the
Colonial Office on the other. In Georgetown, the capital of the
colony, is the immigration department, under the management of
the immigration agent general, who has under him a staff of inspectors,
subagents, clerks, and interpreters, all of whom must speak
at least one Indian dialect. In Calcutta resides the emigration agent
general, also an official of the British Guiana Government, who has
under him a staff of medical officers, recruiting agents, and clerks.</p>

<p>Each year the planters of British Guiana send in requisitions to
the immigration department stating the number of immigrants required
for the following year. These requisitions are examined by
the agent general, and if, in his opinion, any estate demands more
coolies than the extent of its cultivation justifies, the number is reduced.
As soon as the full number is decided on, the agent in Calcutta
is informed, and the process of recruiting commences. The
laborers are secured entirely by voluntary enlistment. The recruiting
agents go about the country and explain the terms offered by the
British Guiana planters, and those men and women who express their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
willingness to enter into a contract are sent down to Calcutta at the
expense of the colony.</p>

<p>On arrival in Calcutta they are provided with free food and quarters
at the emigration depot until such time as a sufficient number
are assembled to form a full passenger list for a transport. During
the period of waiting, which may extend to several weeks, a careful
medical inspection of the laborers is made, and all those who may
be deemed unfit for the work of the estates are sent back to their
homes at the expense of the colony. Prior to embarkation the
coolies are called up in batches of fifteen or twenty, and the emigration
agent or a local magistrate reads over to them in their own language
the terms of the indenture. Each one is then given an indenture
ticket on which the terms of indenture are printed in three
dialects. The agent general affixes his signature to each ticket; and
a special provision in the laws of British Guiana makes his signature
binding on the planters who employ the coolies. The ticket thus constitutes
a contract valid as against either party in the courts of the
colony.</p>

<p>The coolies have the right to carry with them any children they
may wish, and those under twelve years of age are exempt from indenture.
The transportation is effected in sailing vessels, which are
for the time being Government transports. The reason why steamers
are not employed is that sailing vessels are found to be much
healthier, and that the long sea voyage has an excellent effect on the
immigrants. The regulations governing the voyage are very strict.
As far as the coolies are concerned, the ship is in charge of a medical
officer. The captain of the ship, the officers, and the crew are all
under the command of the doctor, except in so far as the actual
sailing of the vessel is in question. The vessel has ample hospital
accommodation, a complete dispensary in charge of a qualified dispenser,
and all the arrangements must be passed by a Government
inspector before the ship is given her clearance. The food to be
furnished during the voyage is specified by law. The bill of fare
consists chiefly of bread, butter, rice, curry, sago, condensed milk,
and fresh mutton, a number of sheep being carried on the ship.</p>

<p>Every morning and evening the doctor makes an inspection of
the vessel, and enters in his log-book all essential details, such as
births, deaths, cases treated in the hospital, and so forth.</p>

<p>On arrival in the colony the coolies are allotted to the different
estates. The coolie is bound to remain for five years on the plantation
to which he is allotted, and to work during that time five days a
week, the day's work being seven hours. In return for this the
planter must furnish him with a house free of rent, and built in
such a way as to meet the requirements of the inspector of immigrants'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
dwellings in regard to ventilation, size, and water supply; and
no immigrants are sent to any estate until these houses have been inspected
and passed as satisfactory. The planter must also furnish
on the estate free hospital accommodation and medical attendance,
and in addition provide free education for the children of indentured
immigrants.</p>

<p>The medical officers are Government servants, and the colony is
divided into districts, each of which has its own doctor, who is compelled
by law to visit each estate in his district at least once in forty-eight
hours and examine and prescribe for all immigrants presenting
themselves at the hospital.</p>

<p>The planter is further bound to pay a minimum daily wage of
twenty-four cents to each man and sixteen cents to each woman.
This appears at first sight a very small sum, but when it is taken
into account that a coolie can live well on eight cents a day it will be
seen that the wage is three times the living expense, a rate very rarely
paid to agricultural laborers in any part of the world.</p>

<p>That the coolies do, in fact, save considerable sums of money will
be seen when the statistics of the immigration department are
examined. These records show that during the years 1870 to 1896
38,793 immigrants returned to India after completing their terms
of indenture, and that they carried back with them to their native
land over $2,800,000. At the end of 1896 there were over five thousand
East Indian depositors in the British Guiana Government Savings
Bank and the Post-Office Savings Bank, with a total sum of more
than $450,000 to their credit.</p>

<p>At the end of five years the indentured coolie becomes absolutely
free. He may cease work, or, if he prefer it, remain on the estates
as a free laborer. The whole colony is open to him, and he may
engage in any trade or profession for which he may be fitted. If
he remains for five years longer in the colony, even though he be
idle during the whole of that time, he becomes entitled to a grant of
land from the Government. The law in this respect has been recently
changed. All coolies who came to the colony prior to 1898 have the
choice at the end of ten years of a free grant of land or an assisted
passage back to their native place.</p>

<p>It may be objected by those persons who are unacquainted with
the system that all this sounds very well on paper, but that the
opportunities for fraud and oppression must be very frequent, and,
human nature being what it is, very frequently taken advantage of,
to the injury of the coolies' interests. Such charges have, in fact,
been made from time to time, but they have, on investigation, proved
to be unfounded, or, at the worst, highly exaggerated. The treatment
of the indentured immigrants in British Guiana was the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
a Royal commission of inquiry in 1870. The appointment of the
commission followed a series of charges made by a certain Mr. Des
Voeux, a magistrate in the colony, in a letter to Earl Granville, at
that time Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>

<p>The commission visited the colony and conducted a most searching
inquiry. Hundreds of witnesses were examined, and the commissioners
visited several estates, without giving any warning of
their intentions, and questioned many of the coolies as to their treatment.
Mr. Des Voeux entirely failed to substantiate his charges; and
Sir Clinton Murdoch, the chairman of the emigration board&mdash;a permanent
department of the Colonial Office&mdash;in referring to the report
of the commission in a blue book issued in 1872, said: "It may,
I think, be considered that the report of the commissioners is generally
satisfactory, both as regards the magistracy, the planters, and
the immigrants. Many defects in the system and mode of working
it are no doubt pointed out, but they are defects caused by errors
of judgment, by insufficiency of the law, or by want of foresight,
not by intentional neglect or indifference to the well-being of the
people, still less by oppression or cruelty. The vindication of the
magistracy and of the medical officers appears to be complete, and
the fair dealing and kindness of the managers toward the immigrants
is acknowledged."</p>

<p>The laws have been amended, the Government inspection has
been made more complete, and to-day it is impossible that any abuse
of power on the part of the planters can pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>To give an instance of the effectiveness of the Government supervision&mdash;each
estate is compelled by law to keep pay lists according to a
form specified by the immigration department, in which the name
of each indentured immigrant must be entered with a record of each
separate day's work during the five years of the indenture. Thus, if
the pay list shows that in a certain week a man worked only two days
out of the legal five, it must also show the reason why he did not work
on the other three days. It may have been that the man was in the
hospital, in which case the letter "H" must appear opposite his
name for those days; or he may have been granted leave of absence,
when the letter "L" would account for him. These pay lists are inspected
by a Government officer twice a month, and any faults disclosed
by the examination become the subject of a severe reprimand
from the agent general, followed in the case of persistent neglect
by the cutting off of the supply of coolies.</p>

<p>So minute are the records of the immigration department that
were an application made to the agent general for information regarding
some particular indentured coolie, that official could without
difficulty supply the name of the man's father and mother, his caste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
age, native place, with the same information in regard to the man's
wife. He could also make out an account showing every day the man
had worked during the term of his indenture, and the reasons
why he had not worked on the other days, with the exact amount
earned on each working day. In addition to this he could state
how many days the man had spent in the estate's hospital and
what was the matter with him on those occasions, besides furnishing
a copy of every prescription made up for the man in the estate's
dispensary.</p>

<p>A striking evidence of the desire of the Government to protect
the coolies from ill treatment of any kind is afforded by the rule of
the immigration department that, if any overseer on an estate is
convicted of an offense against an indentured immigrant, the dismissal
of the offender is demanded, and each estate in the colony is
warned that if it employ the man the supply of immigrants will be
cut off.</p>

<p>The coolies are given every facility to complain of ill-treatment
or breach of contract on the part of the planters, for, in addition to
the opportunity afforded by the regular visits of the subagents, the
right is secured to them by law of leaving any estate without permission
in order to visit the agent general or the nearest magistrate; and
either of these officials has the power to issue all process of law free
of cost to any coolie who satisfies him that there is a <i>prima facie</i>
cause of complaint.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, are the features of the East Indian immigration
system of British Guiana.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Those who approach the question of the labor supply for the
American colonies with an unprejudiced mind will see that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
nothing in the system I have described which is at variance with the
principles of the American people.</p>

<p>All that is required to make such a system a boon both to the
employer and to the laborer is that the officials charged with the inspection
of the system and the protection of the immigrants' interests
should be intelligent, honest, and fearless in the discharge of
their duties.</p>

<h2>PRINCIPLES OF TAXATION.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By the Late Hon. DAVID A. WELLS.</span></p>


<h3>XX.&mdash;THE LAW OF THE DIFFUSION OF TAXES.</h3>

<h4>PART II.</h4>

<p>Attention is next asked to an analysis of the incidence of
taxation, what is mainly direct, on processes and products, and
on the machinery by which one is effected and the other distributed,
and at the outset the following propositions in the nature of economic
axioms are submitted, which it is believed will serve as stepping
stones to the attainment of broad generalizations.</p>

<p>Thus, property is solely produced to supply human wants and desires;
and taxes form an important part of the cost of all production,
distribution, and consumption, and represent the labor performed in
guarding and protecting property at the expense of the State, in all
the processes of development and transformation. The State is thus
an active and important partner in all production. Without its
assistance and protection, production would be impeded or wholly
arrested. The soldier or policeman guards, while the citizen performs
his labor in safety. As a partner in all the forms of production and
business, the State must pay its expenses&mdash;i.e., its agents, for their
services; and its only means of paying are through its receipts from
taxation. Taxes, then, are clearly items of expense in all business,
the same as rent, fuel, cost of material, light, labor, waste, insurance,
clerical service, advertising, expressage, freight, and the like, and
on business principles they find their place on the pages of profit and
loss; and, like all other expenses which enter into the cost of production,
must finally be sustained by those who gratify their wants or
desires by consumption. Production is only a means, and consumption
is the end, and the consumer must pay in the end all the expenses
of production. Every dealer in domestic or imported merchandise
keeps on hand, at all times, upon his shelves, a stock of different
and accumulated taxes&mdash;customs, internal revenue, State,
school, and municipal&mdash;with his goods; and when we buy and carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
away from any store or shop an article, we buy and carry away with
it the accompanying and inherential taxes.</p>

<p>Any primary taxpayer, who does not ultimately consume the
thing taxed, and who does not include the tax in the price of the
taxed property or its products, must literally throw away his money
and must soon become bankrupt and disappear as a competitor; and
accordingly the tax advancer will add the tax in his prices if he understands
simple addition. How rapidly bankruptcy would befall
dealers in imported goods, wares, and merchandise in the United
States who did not strictly observe this rule will be realized when one
remembers that the average tax imposed by its Government (in
1896) on all dutiable imports is in excess of fifty per cent.</p>

<p>When Dr. Franklin was asked by a committee of the English
House of Commons, prior to the American Revolution, if the province
of Pennsylvania did not practically relieve farmers and other landowners
from taxation, and at the same time impose a heavy tax on
merchants, to the injury of British trade, he answered that "if such
special tax was imposed, the merchants were experts with their pens,
and added the tax to the price of their goods, and thus made the
farmers and all landowners pay their part of the tax as consumers."</p>

<p>Taxes uniformly levied on all the subjects of taxation, and which
are not so excessive as to become a prohibition on the use of the thing
taxed, become, therefore, a part of the cost of all production, distribution,
and consumption, and diffuse and equate themselves by natural
laws in the same manner and in the same minute degree as all other
elements that constitute the expenses of production. We produce
to consume and consume to produce, and the cost of consumption, including
taxes, enters into the cost of production, and the cost of
production, including taxes, enters into the cost of consumption, and
thus taxes levied uniformly on things of the same class, by the laws of
competition, supply, and demand, and the all-pervading mediums of
labor, will be distributed, percussed, and repercussed to a remote degree,
until they finally fall upon every person, not in proportion to
his consumption of a given article, but in the proportion his consumption
bears to the aggregate consumption of the taxed community.</p>

<p>A great capitalist, like Mr. Astor, bears no greater burden of taxation
(and can not be made to bear more by any laws that can be
properly termed tax laws) than the proportion which his aggregate
individual consumption bears to the aggregate individual
consumption of all others in his circuit of immediate competition;
and as to his other taxes, he is a mere tax collector, or conduit,
conducting taxes from his tenants or borrowers to the State or
city treasury. A whisky distiller is a tax conduit, or tax collector,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
and sells more taxes than the original cost of whisky, as finds proof
and illustration in the fact that the United States imposes a tax of
one dollar and ten cents per gallon on proof whisky which its manufacturer
would be very glad to sell free of tax for an average of thirteen
cents per gallon. The tax, furthermore, is required to be laid
before the whisky can be removed from the distillery or bonded warehouse
and allowed to become an article of merchandise. Tobacco in
like manner can not go into consumption till the tax is paid. In
Great Britain, where all tobacco consumed is imported, for every
3<i>d.</i> paid by the consumer, 2.5<i>d.</i> represents customs duties or taxes.
In Russia it is estimated that the Government annually requires of
its peasant producers one third the market value of their entire crop
of cereals in payment of their taxes, and fixes the time of collecting
the same in the autumn, when the peasant sells sufficient of his grain
(mainly for exportation), and with the purchase money meets the demands
of the tax collector. Can it be doubted that the sums thus extorted
enter into and form an essential part of the cost of the entire
crop or product of the land? It is, therefore, immaterial where the
process of manufacture takes place; the citizens of a State pay in proportion
to the quantity which they consume. The traveler who stops
at one of the great city hotels can not avoid reimbursing the owner
for the tax he primarily pays on the property; and the owner, in
respect to the taxation of his hotel property, is but a great and effective
real-estate and diffused tax collector. Again, the farmer charges
taxes in the price of his products; the laborer, in his wages; the
clergyman, in his salary; the lender, in the interest he receives; the
lawyer, in his fees; and the manufacturer, in his goods.</p>

<p>The American Bible Society is always in part loaded with the
whisky and tobacco taxes paid by the printers, paper-makers, and book-binders,
or by the producers of articles consumed by these mechanics,
and reflected and embodied in their wages and the products of their
labor according to the degree of absence of competition from fellow-mechanics
who abstain from the use of these and other taxed articles.</p>

<p>These conclusions respecting the diffusion of taxes may be said to
be universally accepted by economists so far as they relate to the results
of production before they reach the hands of the final consumers;
but they are not accepted by many, as Mr. Henry George
has recently expressed it, in respect to taxes on special profits or
advantages on things of which the supply is strictly limited, or of
wealth in the hands of final consumers, or in the course of distribution
by gift, and finally in respect to taxes on land. But a little examination
would seem to show that all of these exceptions are of the kind
that are said to prove the rule. <i>Special profits</i> and advantages in
this age of quick diffusion of knowledge and intense competition are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
exceedingly ephemeral, and are mainly confined to results which the
State with a view of encouraging removes for a limited time from the
natural laws of competition by granting patents, copyrights, and franchises.
Of things which are strictly limited in respect to supply,
what and where are they? Only a very few can be specified: ivory,
Peruvian guano, whalebone, ambergris, and the pelts of the fur seal.
Of wealth in the process of transmission, or in the hands of final consumers,
it is not <i>tangible</i> wealth unless it is <i>tangible</i> property, which
conforms under any correct system of taxation to the principles of
taxation; and if any one advocates the taxation of the right to receive
property which has already been taxed, he in effect advocates a
double exaction of one and the same thing. If it be asked, Will an
income tax on a person retired from business be diffused? the answer,
beyond question, must be in the affirmative, if the tax is uniform
on all persons and on all amounts, and is absolutely collected in
minute sums. Would any one pay the same price for a railroad bond
which is subject to an income tax as he would for it if it was free
from tax? If one's land is taxed, either in the form of rent or income,
will not the tenant have the burden primarily thrown upon
him? And, finally, will not the consumer of the tenant's goods pay
through or by reason of such consumption?</p>

<p>Respecting the incidence of the tax on mortgages, it does not make
any difference how mortgages are taxed&mdash;no earthly power can make
the lender pay it. If the borrower would not agree to pay the tax,
the lender would not loan him money, and whenever possible loans
would be foreclosed and payment insisted upon if the borrower
should refuse to pay the tax.</p>

<p>Let us next subject to analysis the incidence of the so-called taxation
of land. Considered <i>per se</i> (or in itself), land, in common with
unappropriated air and water, has no value; and it can not in any
strict sense be affirmed that we tax land; and when such affirmation
is made, its only legitimate and justifiable meaning is that we
tax the value of land; which value is due entirely to the amount
of personal property (in the sense of embodied labor) expended upon
it, and the pressure or demand of such property or labor to use,
possess, and occupy it.</p>

<p>Vattel, in his Law of Nations, enunciates as a self-evident and
irrefutable proposition that "Nature has not herself established
property, and in particular with regard to lands. She only approves
this introduction for the advantage of the human race."</p>

<p>One of the most striking examples of evidence in illustration and
proof of this proposition is to be found in an incident, which has
heretofore escaped attention, which occurred during a debate in the
Senate of the United States in 1890 on a bill for revision of duties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
on imports, in respect to the article borax (borate of soda). Formerly
the world's supply of this mineral substance, which enters largely into
industrial processes and medicine, was limited, and mainly derived
from certain hot springs in Tuscany, Italy; but within a comparatively
recent period it has been found that it exists in such abundance
in certain of the desert regions of California, Nevada, and Arizona,
that it can be gathered with the minimum of labor from the very
surface of the ground. Were a single acre of similar desert to be
found in any section of a country enjoying the most ordinary privileges
in respect to transportation and water supply, it would be a
source of wealth to its proprietor. But under existing circumstances,
although thousands and thousands of acres of this land can be bought
with certain title from its owner&mdash;the Federal Government&mdash;for
two dollars and twenty-five cents an acre, no one wants it at any
price; and the prospective demand for it has not yet been sufficient
to warrant the Government in instituting even a survey as a preliminary
to effecting a sale. In the Senate debate above alluded to
it was proposed to increase the duty on imported borax, with the expectation
that a consequent increase in its domestic price would
afford sufficient profit to induce such construction of roads and such a
supply of water and labor on the borax tracts of the deserts as to
enable them to become property.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In the oases of the deserts of North Africa and Egypt the value
of a tract of land depends very little upon its size or location, but
almost exclusively upon the number of the date-bearing palms, the
result of labor, growing upon it, and the quality of their fruit.
John Bright on one occasion stated that if the land of Ireland were
stripped of the improvements made upon it by the labor of the occupier,
the face of the country would be "as bare and naked as an
American prairie."</p>

<p>An exact parallel to this state of things is afforded in the case of
lands of no value reclaimed from the sea and made valuable, as has
been often done in England, Holland, and other countries, by embodying
labor upon them in the shape of restraining embankments
and the transportation and use of filling material. Again, the value
of springs or running streams of water is generally limited and of
little account. But when, through direct labor, or the results of labor,
the water is collected in reservoirs and made the instrumentality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
imparting power to machinery, or conducted through conduits to
centers of population which otherwise could not obtain it, it becomes
extremely valuable, and capable of being sold in large or small quantities.
Another similar illustration is to be found in the case of
atmospheric air, which in its natural and ordinary state has no marketable
value, but when compressed by labor embodied in the form
of machinery and made capable of transmitting force, it at once becomes
endowed with value and can be sold at a high price.</p>

<p>An opinion entertained and strongly advocated by not a few
economic writers and teachers of repute (more especially in Europe,
but not in the United States)<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is, that taxes on land do not diffuse
themselves, but fall wholly on the landowner, and that there is no
way in which he can throw it off and cause any considerable part of
them to be paid by anybody else. The concrete argument in support
of this opinion has been thus stated: "When land is taxed, the owner
can not, as a general rule, escape the tax, for the reason that, to get
rid of the tax, the price of the land or of the rent must be raised the
full amount of the tax, and the only way in which this can be done is
by reducing the supply or quantity offered in market, or else by increasing
the demand. The supply of land can not be reduced, and
the demand being created by capital and population, both of which
are beyond the control of the landowner, he can do nothing to raise
the price of land, and hence can not get rid of the tax. It may be
stated, then, as a general rule, that a tax on land, or on any commodity
the supply of which is limited absolutely, must be paid by
the owner. It is possible to suggest cases in which, through combination
of owners and the necessities of consumers, a demand may
be created strong enough to raise the price to the full amount of such
tax, but it is doubted if such cases ever really occur."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The source of the contention on this important economic and
social question, and the difficulty in the way of the attainment of
harmonious conclusions, is due to a nonrecognition of the fact that
land is taxed under two conditions, and can not be taxed otherwise.
Thus, if a person holds land for his exclusive use or enjoyment, and
consumes all of its product, a tax on such land, which has been characterized
by some economists as its "pure rent," will not diffuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
itself, because it is a tax on personal enjoyment or final consumption.
The same is the case when a portion of a river or lake or its shore
is rented for fishing for the purposes of sport. A like result will also
follow, in a greater or less degree, from the inability or unwillingness
of tenants, as has been often the case in Ireland, to pay rent sufficient
to reimburse the landowner for interest on his investment of
capital and cost of repairs. But if one employs land as an instrumentality
for acquiring gain through its uses, the taxation of land
must include the taxation of its uses&mdash;its contents, all that rests upon
it, all that is produced, sold, expended, manufactured, or transported
on it&mdash;and all such taxes will diffuse themselves. On the other hand,
if the taxation of land under such circumstances and conditions does
not diffuse itself, then the taking is simply a process of confiscation,
which if continued will ultimately rob the owner of his property, and
is not governed by any principle.</p>

<p>It is indeed difficult to see how a theory so wholly inapplicable
to fact and experience as that of the nondiffusion of taxes on land&mdash;which
makes property in land an exception to the rule acknowledged
to be applicable to all other property&mdash;could originate and be
strenuously maintained to the extent even of stigmatizing any opposite
view "as so very superficial as scarcely to deserve a refutation."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
No little of confusion and controversy on this subject has arisen from
the assumption that land specifically, and the rent of land, constitute
two distinct and legitimate subjects for taxation, when the fact is just
the contrary. The rent of land is in the nature of an income to its
owner; and it is an economic axiom that when a government taxes
the income of property it in reality taxes the property itself. In England
and on the continent of Europe land is generally taxed on its
yearly income or income value, and these taxes are always considered
as land taxes. Alexander Hamilton, in discussing the taxation of
incomes derived directly from property, used this language: "What,
in fact, is property but a fiction, without the beneficial use of it? In
many instances, indeed, the income is the property itself." The
United States Supreme Court, in its recent decision of the income
tax (1895), also practically indorsed this conclusion. To levy taxes
on the rent of land and also upon the land itself is, therefore, double
taxation on one and the same property, which in common with all
other unequal and unjust taxes can not be diffused; and for this
reason should be regarded as in the nature of exactions or confiscation,
concerning the incidence of which nothing can be safely predicated.
In short, this whole discussion, and the unwarranted assumption involved
in it and largely accepted, is an illustration of what may be
regarded as a maxim, that the greatest errors in political economy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
have arisen from overlooking the most obvious facts or deductions
from experience.</p>

<p>With a purpose of further elucidating this problem, attention is
asked first to its consideration from an "abstract," and next from
a practical standpoint of view. Let us endeavor to clearly understand
the common meaning of the word "<i>rent</i>." It is derived from the
Latin <i>reddita</i>, "things given back or paid," and in plain English is a
word for price or hire. It may be the hire of anything. It is the price
we pay for the right of exclusive use over something which is not our
own. Thus we speak of the rent of land, of buildings and apartments,
of a fishery, of boats, of water, of an opera box, of a piano, sewing machines,
furniture, vehicles, and the like. In Scotland at the present
time farmers hire cows to dairymen, who pay an agreed-upon price
by the year or for a term of years for each cow, and reimburse themselves
for such payment and make a profit on the transaction by the
sale of the products of the animal. This hire is called a rent, and is
clearly the same in kind as the rent of land. We do not apply the
word "hire" to the employment of men, because we have a separate
word&mdash;"wages"&mdash;for that particular case of hire. Neither do we
apply the word "rent" in English to the hire of money, because we
have another separate word&mdash;"interest"&mdash;which has come into special
use for the price paid for the loan or hire of money. But in the
French language the word <i>rent</i> is habitually and specially used to
signify the price of the hire money, and that of "<i>rentes</i>" to
investments of money paying interest; the French national
debt being always spoken of as "<i>les rentes</i>"; while the men who
live on the lending of money, or capital in any form, are called
"<i>rentiers</i>."</p>

<p>The question next naturally arises, Why is it necessary to set
up any special theory at all about the natural disposition of the price
which we pay for the hire of land, any more than about the price we
pay for the hire of a house, of furniture, of a boat, of an opera box,
or of a cow? The particular kind of use to which we put each of
these various things is no doubt very different from the kind of use
to which we put each or all the others. But all of these uses resolve
themselves into the desire we have to derive some pleasure or some
profit by the possession for a time of the right of exclusive use of
something which is not our own, and for which we must pay the price,
not of purchase, but of hire.</p>

<p>The explanation of this curious economic phenomenon is to be
found in the assumption and positive assertion on the part of not a
few distinguished economists that the truly scientific and only correct
use of the term "rent" is its application to the "income derived
from things of all kinds of which the supply is limited, and can not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
increased by man's action."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> As a rule, economists who accept this
definition confine its application to the hire of land alone, although it
professes to include other things, "of all kinds," to which the same
description applies&mdash;namely, that they can not be increased in quantity
by any human action. There are, however, no such other things
specified, and in any literal sense there are no such other things existing,
unless water and the atmosphere be intended.</p>

<p>Now, although it is indisputably true that man by his action
can not increase the absolute or total quantity of land, any more than
of water and air, appertaining to the whole globe on which we live,
there is practically no limitation to the degree of value which man's
action can impart to land, and which is the only thing for which land
is wanted, bought, or sold, and which, as already shown, can be truly
made the subject of taxation. The tracts of land on the earth's surface
which are of no present marketable value are its deserts, its
wildernesses, the sides and summits of its mountains, and its continually
frozen zones, where no results of labor are embodied in or
reflected upon it; while, on the other hand, its tracts of greatest
value are in the large cities and marts of trade and commerce, as in
the vicinity of the Bank of England, or in Wall Street, where the results
of labor are so concentrated and reflected upon land that it is
necessary to cover it with gold in order to acquire by purchase a title
to it and a right to its exclusive use. The difference between land
at twenty-five dollars an acre and twenty-five dollars a square foot is
simply that the latter is or may be in the near future covered or surrounded
by capital and business, while the former is remote from
these sources of value. One of the greatest possible, perhaps probable,
outcomes of the modern progress of chemistry is that through
the utilization of microbic organizations the value of land as an instrumentality
for the production of food may be increased to an extent
that at the present time is hardly possible of conception. Again,
in the case of air and water, although their total absolute quantity
can not be increased, their available and useful quantity in any
place, as before shown, can be by the agency of man, and their use
made subject to hire or rent.</p>

<p>Consideration is next asked to the question at issue from what
may be termed its practical standpoint. We have first a proposition
in the nature of an economic axiom, that the price of everything
necessary for production, or the hire of anything&mdash;land, money, and
the like&mdash;without which the product could not arise, is, and must be,
without exception, a part of the cost of that product; second, that
all levies of the State which are worthy of being designated as taxes
constitute an essential element of the cost of all products. The rent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
of an opera box, given to obtain a mere pleasure, constitutes a part
of the fund out of which the musicians are paid, and if they are not
so paid they will not play or sing. The rent given for the right to fish
on a certain part of a river or its shores is a part of the cost of producing
the fish as a marketable commodity. If a house is hired for
the purpose of conducting any business in it, the price of that hire
does most certainly enter into the cost of that business, whatever it
may be, assuming that the use of the house is a necessity for carrying
it on. As no man will produce a commodity by which he is sure to
lose money, or fail to obtain the ordinary rate of profit, the tax must
be added to the price, or the production will cease. If a uniform tax
is imposed on all land occupied, it will be paid by the occupier, because
occupation (house-building) will cease until the rent rises sufficiently
to cover the tax. The landlord assesses upon his tenants the
tax he has paid upon his real estate; each tenant assesses his share
upon each of his customers; and so perfect is this diffusion of land
taxation that every traveler from a distant part of the country who
remains for even a single day at a hotel pays, without stopping to think
about it, a portion of the taxes on the building, first paid by the
owner, then assessed upon the lessees, and next cut up by them
minutely in the <i>per diem</i> charge. But of course neither the owner
nor lessee really escapes taxation, because a portion of somebody
else's tax is thrown back upon them.</p>

<p>Is it possible to believe that in a city like New York, where less
than four per cent of its population pay any direct tax on real estate,
or in a city like Montreal, where the expenses of the city are mainly
derived from taxes on land and the building occupancy of land, the
great majority of the inhabitants of those cities are exempt from all
land taxation? In China, where, as before shown, the title or ownership
of all land vests in the emperor, and the revenue of the Government
is almost exclusively derived from taxation of land in the form
of rent, does the burden of tax remain upon the owner of the land?
If the tax in the form of rent is paid in the products of the land, as
undoubtedly it is in part, will not the cost of the percentage of the
whole product of the land that is thus taken increase to the renter
the cost of the percentage that is left to him; or, if the product is
sold for money with which to pay the tax rent, will not its selling
price embody the cost of the tax, as it will the cost of every other
thing necessary for production? To affirm to the contrary is to
say that the price which the Chinese farmer pays for the right
of the exclusive use of his land is no part of the crops he may raise
upon it.</p>

<p>Consider next the assertion of those who maintain the nondiffusion
theory that taxes on land are paid by the owners because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
supply of land can neither be increased nor diminished. In answer
to it we have the indisputable fact that the owners of land, whenever
taxes are increased, attempt to obtain an increased rental for
it if the circumstances will permit it. And the very attempt tends
to increase the rent. Nothing but adverse circumstances, such as
diminishing population or commercial and industrial distress, can
prevent a rise in the rental of land on which the taxes are increased;
and in the case of dwellings and warehouses the rise is almost always
very prompt, because no man will erect new dwellings or warehouses
unless their rent compensate fully the increase of taxation. And in
any prosperous community, in which population increases in the
natural ratio, there must be a constant increase of dwellings and
warehouses to prevent a rise of rent, independent of higher wages
and higher taxation. In no other occupation is capital surer of obtaining
the average net remuneration than in the erection of dwellings
and warehouses, and nothing but lack of general prosperity and
diminishing population can throw the burden of taxation on real
estate or its owners, without the slightest attempt at combination on
their part. If the owners of land are not reimbursed for its taxation
by its occupants, new houses "would not be erected, the old ones
would wear out, and after a time the supply would be so small that
the demand would raise rents, and house building begin again, the
tax having been transferred to the occupier."</p>

<p>It is pertinent at this point to notice the averment that is frequently
made, that cultivators of the soil can not incorporate taxes
on the land in the price of their products, because the price of
their whole crop is fixed by the price at which any portion of it can
be sold in foreign markets. In answer to this we have first the fact
that, to give the population of the world an adequate supply of
food and other agricultural products, it is not only necessary that all
the land at present under cultivation shall continue to be so employed,
but further that new lands shall each year be brought under
cultivation, or else the land already cultivated shall be made more
productive.</p>

<p>The population of the world steadily increases, notwithstanding
wars, epidemics, and all the evils which are consequences of man's
ignorance and of his improper use of things, his own faculties included.
Hence, in case of increased taxation on land, the cultivator
of the soil is generally enabled to transfer easily and promptly the
burden of the tax to the purchasers of the products he raises, without
abandoning the cultivation even of the least productive soil.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the exports of many agricultural products are due
not to the cheapness of their cost of production, but to the variations
which occur in the productiveness of the crops of other countries. M.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
Rouher, a French economist, and for a period a minister of commerce,
thoroughly investigated this matter, and proved by incontestable data
that almost invariably when the yield of breadstuffs in Europe was
large in the country drained by the Black and Baltic Seas, it was small
in the countries drained by the Atlantic. This variation in the yield
of agricultural crops forces the countries where crops are deficient
to purchase from those where they are abundant, or who have a surplus
on hand from previous abundant harvests. In the United
States, when the harvests are abundant, the American farmers, rather
than sell below a certain price, keep a portion of their crops on hand
until bad crops in Europe produce a foreign demand, which has to be
supplied at once. Under such circumstances those who hold the
surplus stock of breadstuffs, or any other product, would control the
price, and not the foreigners who stand in need of it. The only check,
then, to the cupidity of the holders of breadstuffs is the competition
between themselves, which invariably suffices to prevent any undue
advantage being taken of the necessities of the countries whose harvests
are deficient. These bad crops occur frequently enough to consume
all the surplus of the countries that produce in excess of their
own wants. In fact, this transient, irregular demand is counted upon
and provided for by producers just as much so as the regular home
demand&mdash;hence is one of the elements that regulate production and
control prices.</p>

<p>At this point of the discussion it is desirable to obtain a clear and
true idea of the meaning or definition of the phrase "diffusion of
taxes." As sometimes used in popular and superficial discussions, it
is held to imply that every tax imposed by law distributes itself
equitably over the whole surface of society. Such implication would,
however, be even more fallacious than an assumption that every expenditure
made by an individual distributes itself in such a way that
it becomes equally an expenditure by every other individual. On
the other hand, a fair consideration of the foregoing summary of facts
and deductions would seem to compel every mind not previously
warped by prejudice to accept and indorse the following as great
fundamental principles in taxation: <i>First</i>, that in order to burden
equitably and uniformly all persons and property, for the purpose
of obtaining revenue for public purposes, it is not necessary to tax
primarily and uniformly all persons and property within the taxing
district. <i>Second</i>, equality of taxation consists in a uniform assessment
of the same articles or class of property that is subject to taxation.
<i>Third</i>, taxes under such a system equate and diffuse themselves;
and if levied with certainty and uniformity upon tangible
property and fixed signs of property, they will, by a diffusion and
repercussion, reach and burden all visible property, and also all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
the so-called "invisible and intangible" property, with unerring
certainty and equality.</p>

<p>All taxation ultimately and necessarily falls on consumption; and
the burden of every man, under any equitable system of taxation,
and which no effort will enable him to avoid, will be in the exact proportion
or ratio which his aggregate consumption maintains to the
aggregate consumption of the taxing district, State, or community of
which he is a member.</p>

<p>It is not, however, contended that unequal taxation on competitors
of the same class, persons, or things diffuses itself whether such
inequality be the result of intention or of defective laws, and their
more defective administration. And doubtless one prime reason why
economists and others interested have not accepted the law of diffusion
of taxes as here given is that they see, as the practical workings
of the tax systems they live under, or have become practically familiar
with, that taxes in many instances do seem to remain on the
person who immediately pays them; and fail to see that such result is
due&mdash;as in the case of the taxation of large classes of the so-called
personal property&mdash;to the adoption of a system which does not permit
of equality in assessment, and therefore can not be followed by
anything of equality in diffusion. Such persons may not unfairly be
compared to physicists, who, constantly working with imperfect instruments,
and constantly obtaining, in consequence, defective results,
come at last to regard their errors as in the nature of established
truths.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>
<p>According to these conclusions, the greatest consumers must be
the greatest taxpayers. The man also who evades a tax clearly robs
his neighbors. The thief also pays taxes indirectly, for he is a consumer,
and must pay the advanced price caused by his own roguery
for all he consumes, although he does steal the money to pay with.
Idlers and even tramps pay taxes, but the amount that they indirectly
pay into the fund is much less than they take out of it. People are
sometimes referred to or characterized as non-taxpayers, and in
political harangues and socialistic essays measures or policies are
recommended by which certain persons or classes, by reason of their
extreme poverty, shall be entirely exempt from all incidence or burden
of taxation. Such a person does not, however, exist in any
civilized community. If one could be found he would be a greater
curiosity than exists in any museum. To avoid taxation a man must
go into an unsettled wilderness where he has no neighbors, for as
soon as he has a companion, if that companion be only a dog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
which he in part or all supports, taxation begins, and the more
companions he has, the greater improvements he makes, and the
higher civilization he enjoys, the heavier will be the taxes he
must pay.</p>

<p>Taxes <i>legitimately</i> levied, then, are a part of the cost of all production,
and there can be no more tendency for taxes to remain upon
the persons who immediately pay them than there is for rents, the
cost of insurance, water supply, and fuel to follow the same law.
The person who wishes to use or destroy the utility of property
by consumption to gratify his desires, or satisfy his wants, can not
obtain it from the owners or producers with their consent, except by
gift, without giving pay or services for it; and the average price of
all property is coincident with the cost of production, including the
taxes advanced upon it, which are a part of its cost in the hands of the
seller. Again, no person who produces any form of property or
utility, for the purpose of sale or rent, sustains any burden of legitimate
taxation, although he may be a tax advancer; for, as a tax
advancer, he is the agent of the State, and a tax collector from the
consumer. But he who produces or buys, and does not sell or rent,
but consumes, is the taxpayer, and sustains a tax in his aggregate consumption,
where all taxation must ultimately rest. In short, no person
bears the burden of taxation, under an equitable, legitimate
system, except upon the property which he applies to his own exclusive
use in ultimate consumption. The great consumer is the only
great taxpayer.</p>

<p>Finally, a great economic law pointed out by Adam Smith, which
has an important and almost conclusive bearing upon this vexed
problem of the diffusion of taxes, should not be overlooked&mdash;namely,
his statement in The Wealth of Nations that "<i>no tax can ever reduce
for any considerable time the rate of profit in any particular trade,
which must always keep its level with other trades in the neighborhood</i>."
In other words, taxes and profits, by the operation of the laws
of human nature, constantly tend to equate themselves. Man is
always prompted to engage in the most profitable occupation and to
make the most profitable investment. And since the emancipation
from feudalism with its sumptuary laws, legal regulations of the
price of labor and merchandise, and other arbitrary governmental invasions
of private rights, individual judgment and self-interest have
been recognized as the best tests or arbiters of the profitableness of a
given investment or occupation. The average profits, therefore, of
one form of investment, or of one occupation (as originally shown by
Adam Smith), must for any long period equal the average profits of
other investments and occupations, whether taxed or untaxed, skill,
risk, and agreeableness of occupation being taken into consideration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Natural laws will, accordingly, always produce an equilibrium
of burden between taxed and untaxed things and persons. There is
a level of profit and a level of taxation by natural laws, as there is a
level of the ocean by natural laws. In fact, all proportional contributions
to the State from direct competitors are diffused upon persons
and things in the taxing jurisdiction by a uniformity as manifest
as is the pressure upon water, which is known to be equal in every
direction.</p>

<p>A word here in reference to the popular idea that the exemption
of any form of property is to grant a favor to those who possess such
property. This idea has, however, no warrant for its acceptance.
Thus, an exemption is freedom from a burden or service to which
others are liable; but in case of the exclusion of an entire class of
property from primary taxation, no person is liable, and therefore
there is no exemption. An exclusion of all milk from taxation, while
whisky is taxed, is not an exemption, for the two are not competing
articles, or articles of the same class. It is true that highly excessive
taxation of a given article may cause another and similar article, in
some instances, to become a substitute or competing article; and
hence the necessity of care and moderation in establishing the rate of
taxation. We do not consider that putting a given article into the
free list, under the tariff, is an exemption to any particular individual;
but if we make the rate higher on one taxpayer or on one
importer of the same article than on another taxpayer or importer,
we grant an exemption. We use the word "exemption," therefore,
imperfectly, when we speak of "the exemption of an entire class of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
property," as, for example, upon all personal property; for if the
removal of the burden operates uniformly on all interested, or owning
such property, then there can be no primary exemption.</p>

<h2>THE GREAT BOMBARDMENT.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By CHARLES F. HOLDER.</span></p>


<p>A thin stratum of air, an invisible armor of great tenuity,
lies between man and the menace of possible annihilation.</p>

<p>The regions of space beyond our planet are filled with flying fragments.
Some meet the earth in its onward rush; others, having
attained inconceivable velocity, overtake and crash into the whirling
sphere with loud detonation and ominous glare, finding destruction
in its molecular armor, or perhaps ricocheting from it again into the
unknown. Some come singly, vagrant fragments from the infinity
of space; others fall in showers like golden rain; all constituting a
bombardment appalling in its magnitude. It has been estimated that
every twenty-four hours the earth or its atmosphere is struck by
<i>four hundred million</i> missiles of iron or stone, ranging from an
ounce up to tons in weight. Every month there rushes upon the
flying globe at least twelve billion iron and stone fragments, which,
with lurid accompaniment, crash into the circumambient atmosphere.
Owing to the resistance offered by the air, few of these solid shots
strike the earth. They move out of space with a possible velocity of
thirty or forty miles per second, and, like moths, plunge into the
revolving globe, lured to their destruction by its fatal attraction. The
moment they enter our atmosphere they ignite; the air is piled up
and compressed ahead of them with inconceivable force, the resultant
friction producing an immediate rise in temperature, and the shooting
star, the meteor of popular parlance, is the result.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illo_080_ideal.jpg" width="500" height="577" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ideal View of the Earth as it is Bombarded by the Estimated Four Hundred Million
Meteorites every Twenty-four Hours.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span>
</span></div>

<p>A simple experiment, made by Joule and Thomson, well illustrates
the possibility of this rise in temperature by atmospheric friction.
If a wire is whirled through the air at a rate of one hundred
and seventy-five feet per second, a rise of one degree, centigrade, will
be noticed. If the revolutions are increased to three hundred and
seventy-two feet per second, the elevation will be 5.3&deg; C. If the
temperature increases as the square of the velocity, a rate of speed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
of twenty miles per second would develop a temperature not far
from 360,000&deg; C., which is probably far less than that at the surface
of the ordinary meteor as it is seen blazing through our atmosphere.
If the meteor is small it is often consumed by the intense
heat generated; but larger fragments, owing to their velocity and
the fact that they are poor conductors of heat and burn slowly, reach
the surface and bury themselves in the sea or earth. But few escape
the inevitable consequences of the contact, and of the untold millions
which have struck the earth within the memory of man but five
hundred and thirty have been seen to fall. The phenomena associated
with the plunging meteor is most interesting. A blaze of light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
as the terrific heat ignites the iron, announces its entrance into our
atmosphere. It may be red, yellow, white, green, or blue, all these
hues having been observed. Then follows the explosion, caused by
the contact with the air piled up ahead, and in certain instances a
loud detonation or a series of noises is heard, which may be repeated
indefinitely until the meteoric mass is completely destroyed, and
drops, a shower of disintegrated particles, which fall rattling to the
ground.</p>

<p>The blaze of light does not continue to the earth, nor does the
meteor, should it survive, strike the ground with the velocity with
which it entered the atmosphere, as the latter often arrests its motion
so completely that it drops upon the earth by its own weight, well
illustrated by the meteorites of the Hesslefall, which dropped upon
ice but a few inches thick, rebounding as they fell. Thus the atmosphere
protects the inhabitants of the globe from a terrific bombardment
by destroying many of the largest meteorites, reducing the size
of others before they reach the surface and arresting the velocity so
that few bury themselves deeply in the soil.</p>

<p>The writer observed a remarkable meteor in 1894. It entered
our atmosphere, apparently, over the Mojave Desert, in California,
and exploded over the San Gabriel Valley, though without any appreciable
sound, and after the first flash disappeared, leaving in the
air a large balloon-shaped object of yellow light which lasted some
moments, presenting a remarkable spectacle. In this instance the
meteor had probably exploded or been consumed, leaving only the
light to tell the story, the atmospheric armor of the earth having
successfully warded off the blow.</p>

<p>Viewing the facts as they exist, the earth, a seeming fugitive mass
flying through space, vainly endeavoring to break the bonds which
bind it to the sun, hunted, bombarded with strange missiles hurled
from unseen hands or forces from the infinity of space, it is little
wonder that the ancients and some savage races of later times invested
the phenomena with strange meanings. It requires but little
imagination to see in the flying earth a living monster followed by
shadowy furies which hurl themselves upon it, now vainly attempting
to reach the air-protected body or again striking it with terrific
force, lodging deep in its sides amid loud reverberation and dazzling
blaze of light.</p>

<p>Meteorites have been known from the very earliest times, and
have often been regarded as miraculous creatures to be worshiped
and handed down from family to family. The famous meteorite
which fell in Phrygia, centuries ago, was worshiped as Cybele, "the
mother of the gods," and about the year 204 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> was carried to
Rome with much display and ceremony, when people of all classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
fell down before it, deeming it a messenger from the gods. Diana
of Ephesus and the famous Cyprian Venus were, in all probability,
meteoric stones which were seen to fall, and were worshiped for the
same reason as above. Livy describes a shower of meteorites which
fell about the Alban Mount 652 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The senate was demoralized,
and certain prophets announced it a warning from heaven, so impressing
the lawmakers that they declared a nine-days' festival with
which to propitiate the gods. The visitor to Mecca will find enshrined
in a place of honor a meteorite which can be traced back beyond
600 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and which is worshiped by pilgrims. The Tartars
pointed out a meteorite to Pallas, in 1772, which had fallen at
Krasnojarsk, and which they considered a holy messenger from
heaven. A large body of meteoric iron found in Wichita County,
Texas, was regarded by the Indians as a fetich. They told strangers
that it came from the sky as a messenger from the Great Spirit.
This meteorite was stationed at a point where two Indian trails met,
and was observed and worshiped as a shrine.</p>

<p>The Chinese have records of meteors which fell 644 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> The
oldest authentic fall in which the stone is preserved is that of
Ensisheim, Elsass, Germany, in 1492. The stone, which weighed
two hundred and sixty pounds, fell with a loud roar, much to the
dismay of the peasantry, penetrating the ground to a depth of five
feet. It was secured by King Maximilian, who, after presenting the
Duke Sigismund with a section, hung the remainder in the parish
church as a holy relic, where, it is said, it may still be seen.</p>

<p>Meteorites vary in size from minute objects not larger than a pea
to masses of iron of enormous size. The Chupaderos meteorite, which
fell in Chihuahua, Mexico, weighs twenty-five tons. Another, which
fell in Kansas, broke into myriads of pieces, the sections found
weighing thirteen hundred pounds. A meteorite in the Vienna
Museum, which fell in Hungary, weighs six hundred and forty-seven
pounds, while the Cranbourne meteorite in the British Museum
weighs four tons. The Red River meteorite in the Yale Museum
weighs sixteen hundred and thirty pounds. The largest meteorite
known was discovered within the Arctic Circle by Lieutenant Peary.
The Eskimos had known of it for generations as a source of supply
for iron. It was found by Lieutenant Peary in May, 1894, but,
owing to its enormous weight, could not be removed until the summer
of 1897, when, after much labor, it was excavated and hoisted
into the hold of the steam whaling bark Hope and carried to New
York, where it has found a resting place in the cabinet of the American
Museum of Natural History. It is believed to weigh one hundred
tons.</p>

<p>Up to 1772 the stories of bodies falling from space were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
entertained seriously by scientific men. So eminent a scientist as
Lavoisier, after thoroughly investigating a case, decided that it
was merely a stone which had been struck by lightning. Falls
finally occurred which demonstrated beyond dispute that the missiles
came from space, and science recognized the fact that the earth was
literally being bombarded, and that human safety was due to the
atmospheric armor, scarcely one hundred miles thick, that enveloped
the earth. Instances of the destruction of human life from this cause
are very rare. Some years ago a meteorite crushed into the home of
an Italian peasant, killing the occupant; and cattle have been known
to be destroyed by them; but such instances are exceptional. In
1660 a meteorite fell at Milan, on the authority of the Italian
physicist Paolo Maria Tezzayo, killing a Franciscan monk. Humboldt
is authority for the statement that a monk was struck dead by a
meteorite at Crema, September 4, 1511; and in 1674, on the same
authority, a meteorite struck a ship at sea and killed two Swedish
sailors.</p>

<p>In December, 1795, at Wold Cottage, in Yorkshire, England, a
stone weighing fifty pounds dashed through the air with a loud roar,
alarming people in the vicinity, and burying itself in the ground
not thirty feet from a laborer. This mass, though undoubtedly
traveling, when it struck our atmosphere, at a rate of at least thirty
miles a second, was checked so completely that it sank but twelve
inches into the soft chalk. Great as is the heat generated during the
passage of a meteorite through the air, it does not always permeate
the entire body. This was well illustrated in the case of the meteorite
which fell at Dhurmsala, Kangra, Punjaub, India, in 1860, fragments
of which can be seen in the Field Museum in Chicago. Of it
Dr. Oliver C. Farington says: "The fragments were so cold as to
benumb the fingers of those who collected them. This is perhaps
the only instance known in which the cold of space has become perceptible
to human senses."</p>

<p>Some of the individual falls during recent years have attracted
widespread attention. One of the most remarkable is known as the
Great Kansas Meteor. It was evidently of large size, flashing into
sight eighty or ninety miles from the earth, on the 20th of June,
1876, over the State of Kansas. To the first observers it appeared to
come from the vicinity of the moon, and resembled a small moon
or a gigantic fire ball, blazing brightly, and creating terror and
amazement among thousands of spectators who witnessed its flight.
It passed to the east, disappearing near the horizon in a blaze of light.
The entire passage occupied nearly fifty seconds, being visible to the
inhabitants of Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois,
Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span></p>

<p>This visitor created the greatest alarm and apprehension along
its path, the blaze of light being accompanied by repeated explosions
and detonations which sounded like the rumble and roar of cannonading.
To some it appeared like the rattling of heavy teams over a
rough, rocky road; others believed subterranean explosions accompanied
the fall. Horses ran away, stock hurried bellowing to cover,
and men, women, and children crouched in fear or fled before the
fiery visitor whose roar was distinctly heard several minutes after
it had disappeared. As the meteor crossed the Mississippi River the
noise of the explosions increased in severity, and were distinctly heard
sixty or seventy miles from its path, or a distance of one hundred
and forty miles apart. The great ball of flame remained intact as it
crossed five or six States, but as it passed over central Illinois loud
detonations were heard and the light spread out like an exploding
rocket with flashing points. This was the death and destruction of
the monster, and from here it dashed on, a stream or shower of countless
meteors instead of a solid body, forming over Indiana and Ohio
a cluster over forty miles long and five in breadth, showing that while
the meteor had broken up it was still moving with great velocity.
How far it traveled is not known, as it was not seen to strike. Observers
in Pennsylvania saw it rushing in the direction of New York,
and people in that State, where the day was cloudy, heard strange
rumblings and detonations. Houses rattled, and the inhabitants
along the line the meteor was supposed to have passed accredited the
phenomena to an earthquake. Somewhere, perhaps in the forest
region of the Adirondacks, or in the Atlantic, lies the wreck of this
meteor. But one fragment was found. A farmer in Indiana, while
watching its passage heard the thud of a falling object, and going to
the spot the following morning found a small meteorite weighing two
thirds of a pound.</p>

<p>This marvelous body was first observed in all probability in the
northwestern corner of the Indian Territory, possibly sixty or
seventy miles above the earth, and from here it dashed along with
repeated explosions, almost parallel to the earth's surface, disappearing
over New York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span></p>

<p>Another remarkable meteor fell into the Atlantic Ocean far out
at sea, July 20, 1860. It resembled the one mentioned above in that
it was accompanied by a marvelous pyrotechnic display. It first appeared
in the vicinity of Michigan, blazing out with a fiery glow that
filled the heavens with light. Cocks crowed, oxen lowed, and people
rushed from their homes along its course over the States of New
York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. When last seen, over the Atlantic,
it had separated into three parts, which followed each other as
separate fire bodies, without the noise which was the accompanying
feature of the Kansas meteor.</p>

<p>Doubtless the majority of meteors plunge into the ocean, and in
modern times several large meteoric bodies have narrowly escaped
passing vessels. On December 1, 1896, the officers of the ship Walkomming,
bound from New York to Bremen, noticed a large and
brilliant meteor flashing down upon them. Its direction was from
southeast to northwest, and it plunged into the sea ahead of the
vessel with a loud roar and hissing sound; a few minutes later an
immense tidal wave, presumably caused by the fall, struck the ship,
doing no little damage. Even more remarkable was the escape of the
British ship Cawdor, which was given up by the underwriters, but
which reached San Francisco November 20, 1897. During a heavy
storm, August 20th, a large meteor flashed from the sky and passed
between the main and mizzen masts, crashing into the sea with a
blinding flash and deafening detonation. For a moment it was
thought the ship was on fire, and the air was filled with sulphurous
fumes.</p>

<p>In 1888 a meteor dashed into the atmosphere of the earth and
made a brilliant display over southern California. It appeared between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
twelve and one o'clock in the morning, and shot across the
heavens, a fiery red mass&mdash;not like the ordinary meteor, but writhing
and twisting in a manner peculiarly its own, resembling a huge serpent.
When it had passed nearly across the sky it apparently
stopped and doubled in the form of a horseshoe, according to the
informant of the writer, as large as a half-mile race track. The
horseshoe remained visible several minutes, gradually disappearing.
The brilliancy of this meteor can be imagined when it is known that
the entire San Gabriel Valley was illumined as though an electric
light of great power had suddenly been flashed upon it.</p>

<p>Some time in past ages a meteorite weighing at least ten tons
shot into our atmosphere and struck the earth near the famous Ca&ntilde;on
Diablo in Arizona, the mysterious gulch crossed by the Atchison,
Topeka and Santa F&eacute; Railroad. The discovery was made several
years ago by a sheep herder, named Armijo. Finding a piece of iron
with a peculiar lustrous surface which he believed to be silver, he carried
it to one of the towns, where it finally fell into the hands of a
geologist, who pronounced it a meteorite. The discovery was followed
up, and on the crest and in the vicinity of a singular cone about four
thousand feet in diameter pieces of a meteorite were found on the
surface, which gave a combined weight of ten tons, in all probability
but a fraction of the real monster. The iron masses were widely
scattered over the slope and the adjacent <i>mesa</i>, and it was
assumed that a gigantic meteorite or star had fallen and produced
the cone, another striking the earth and forming what is now known
as the Ca&ntilde;on Diablo. A large piece of meteoric iron was found
twenty miles from the cone; another eight miles east of it; two
thousand pieces weighing not over a few pounds or ounces were
taken from the slopes; two exceeding a thousand pounds were found
within a half mile, while forty or fifty weighing about one hundred
pounds were discovered within a radius of half a mile. Here not
only a meteor, but a large-sized meteoric shower, had succeeded in
penetrating the armor of the earth, leaving many evidences of the
extraordinary occurrence which may have been witnessed by the
early man of what is now known as Arizona. From the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
and interesting evidence a geologist deduced the hypothesis that the
crater known as Coon Butte could have been produced by a meteor
with a diameter of fifteen hundred feet, and a careful examination
with a view of discovering it was made with nicely adjusted magnetic
instruments; but in no instance did they indicate the presence
of a vast body of metal buried in the earth, and it was assumed that
the striking of the crater by the colossal meteorite was a chance
blow.</p>

<p>The meteorites or foreign bodies which bombard the earth may
be included in three classes&mdash;meteoric irons or a&euml;rosiderites, meteoric
iron stones or a&euml;rosiderolites, and meteoric stones, a&euml;rolites&mdash;all containing
elements, about twenty-five in number, which have been
found upon the earth. The most conspicuous and important are
silicon, iron, nickel, magnesium, sulphur, carbon, and phosphorus,
while the others are aluminum, antimony, arsenic, calcium, chlorine,
chromium, cobalt, copper, hydrogen,
lithium, manganese, oxygen, potassium,
sodium, tin, and titanium. Hydrogen
and the diamond have also been observed.
A number of interesting
chemical compounds are found in meteorites
not known on the earth, and a
study of their character shows that the
conditions under which the meteors
were formed were entirely different
from those which saw the beginning of
things terrestrial. In brief, where meteors
were born there was an absence of air and water. On the other
hand, there was at some stage in the history of meteorites an abundance
of hydrogen. The meteoric irons are made up principally of
iron with an alloy of nickel, and show a rich crystalline structure, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
various angles producing a variety of forms known as <i>Widmanstatten</i>
figures which a few years ago formed the basis of a singular sensation.
The figures were supposed to be fossil shells and various animals of a
diminutive size which once populated the wrecked world of which
the meteor was assumed to be a part. These meteoric animals from
space were named and classified by several observers, who were
finally forced to acknowledge that their creations were the fanciful
markings of crystallization.</p>

<p>Another class of meteorites (meteoric iron stones) may be described
as spongy masses of nickeliferous iron in whose pores are
found grains of chryosite and other silicates. A type of these bodies
is the meteor of Pallas, which was discovered by him in 1772. The
third class of meteoric stones are those in which the stony or silicous
predominates. As a rule they contain scattered metallic grains, but
certain ones, as the a&euml;rolite which fell at Gara, France, in 1806, contain
metallic constituents.</p>

<p>The a&euml;rolites present an attractive appearance when made into
sections, showing crystals and splinterlike fragments, and under the
glass seem to be made up of many minute spheres ranging from those
the size of a cherry down to others invisible to the naked eye. The
minerals prominent in their composition are chrysolite, bronzite,
augite, enstatite, feldspar, chronite, etc., showing a marked similarity
to the eruptive rocks so well known on the earth. The collections of
famous meteorites in the various museums of the world have constantly
been examined and studied with a view to determine their
origin, the question being a fascinating one to layman and scientist.
Astronomers in the past have variously answered the question.
The flying fragments were believed by some to be the wreckage of
other worlds. Planets had perhaps collided and been rent asunder
in former ages, and space filled with the flying fragments. Others
thought that meteors were molten matter thrown from the earth or
moon. All these theories have been relinquished in view of evidence
of a more or less convincing character pointing to the conclusion that
the bombardment of the earth is one of the results of the disintegration
of comets. In other words, cometary matter flying not always
blindly through space, but in the orbit of the comet of which it
originally formed a part, constituting the missiles.</p>

<p>It is known that the meteors were formed in a region where air
and water were absent. It is equally evident that life was not a
factor in the past history of the bodies, though it must be acknowledged
that the hydrocarbons resembling terrestrial bitumens which
are found in some meteorites suggest the possibility of vegetable life.
These comets, the mysterious bodies which seem to be roving through
space, misconceived planets, as it were, forced into the world half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
made up, offer the best known solution, as they are literally worlds
without air or water, enveloped in a strange and ever-changing substitute
for atmosphere; ghostly worlds, which seem to be drawn to
the sun, then thrown out into space again to repeat the act until the
mighty change from close contact with the fiery mass to the intense
cold of distant realms wrecks them, scatters their fragments through
the infinity of space where they form gigantic rings or clusters of
meteoric matter, raining down upon the sun and planets and all
heavenly bodies which meet them, adding fuel to the former, material
substance to the latter, and in the case of the moon pitilessly
bombarding her crust&mdash;illustrating the effect of the bombardment of
the earth were it deprived of its atmospheric armor.</p>

<p>The evidence which enabled astronomers to definitely associate
comets with meteoric showers and falling stars leads one into a world
of romance. Schiaparelli, the distinguished Italian astronomer,
made the discovery that meteors had a cometic origin. He had been
calculating the orbit and motion of the meteorites which produce the
August showers, when it occurred to him that they corresponded with
those of a certain comet. By following up this clew it was discovered
that the orbit of Tempel's comet corresponded with that of
the meteors of the November star shower. The most remarkable
evidence was that produced by Biela's comet, discovered in 1826. It
had a revolution about the sun of six years and eight months. It
was seen in 1772, 1805, 1832, 1845, and 1852. The vast mass,
which appeared to be rushing around the sun with remarkable velocity,
became separated in 1846, dividing into two parts, one hundred
and fifty thousand or two hundred thousand miles from each
other. In six years the separation had increased to about one and
a half million miles. What mighty cataclysm in infinite space
caused this rupture the mind of man can not conceive, but something
occurred which rent the a&euml;rial giant asunder, and so far as
known completed its wreck, as from that time Biela's comet has not
been seen. In 1872 the comet was looked for, and astronomers predicted
that if it did not appear a shower of stars or meteors would
be visible&mdash;the remains of the lost traveler through space&mdash;and that
they would diverge from a point in Andromeda.</p>

<p>This remarkable prediction was verified in every particular.
When the moment for the appearance of the comet arrived, November 27,
1872, there burst upon the heavens, not Biela's comet, but
a marvelous shower of shooting stars, which dashed down from the
constellation of Andromeda as predicted. In 1885 this was duplicated,
and the atmosphere was apparently filled with shooting stars.
Biela's comet had met disaster in infinite space, and the earth was
being bombarded with the wreckage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span></p>

<p>It is difficult to comprehend the vastness of these clusters of meteors
which constitute the wreck of comets and the source of the
principal bombardments. Thus the August stream, which gives us
the brilliant displays of summer nights, is supposed to be ten million
miles in thickness, as the earth dashing through at a rate of two
million miles a day is several days in passing it. We cross the November
stream of meteors in a few hours, suggesting a width of forty
thousand or fifty thousand miles. This stream of metallic bodies is
hundreds of millions of miles in length, and contains myriads of projectiles
which may yet be hurled upon the earth or some of the planets
of the solar system.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span></p>

<p>But one piece of Biela's comet, so far as known, was found&mdash;a
fragment weighing eight pounds falling at Mazapil, Mexico, where it
remains one of the most inspiring and interesting of inanimate objects.
For years the vast metallic mass, of which this piece formed a
part, rushed through space, covering millions of miles; now near the
burning surface of the sun, now in regions of space where its heat
was scarcely perceptible. For over a century this monster was observed
by the inhabitants of the earth, and finally a portion fell and
human beings handled and examined it.</p>

<p>The fiery messengers which dash down singly upon the earth, the
showers of meteoric stones which flash through our atmosphere with
ephemeral gleams, are, then, the remains of gigantic comets which
have been seen rushing with apparent erratic course through space,
and which by unknown causes have been destroyed and now as
meteoric clusters, one of which is estimated to be one billion miles in
length and one hundred thousand miles in thickness, and to contain
one hundred thousand million meteors, are swinging through space,
with many erratic and wandering forms, pouring upon the earth and
all the planets of the solar system a mighty and continuous bombardment.</p>

<h2>THE SPIRIT OF CONQUEST.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. NOVICOW.</span></p>


<p>The spirit of conquest produces a gigantic aggregation of calamities
and sufferings. A large number of persons still regard conquests
with a favoring eye. Now, what does a conquest signify? It
is the arming of a band of soldiers and going and taking possession
of a territory. Although such expeditions may appear useful, lucrative,
legitimate, and even glorious, little regard is paid, in conducting
them, to the good of societies; for, in spite of all euphemisms,
such military enterprises are robbery, and nothing else, all the time.</p>

<p>Generous spirits who talk about suppressing war do great injury
to mankind. Setting themselves in pursuit of a chimera, they abandon
the road that leads to concrete and positive results. Realists
treat the partisans of perpetual peace as Utopian dreamers, and refuse
to follow them. The noblest and most generous efforts are
thus wholly lost. The direction of public opinion is left to empirics
and retrogrades, to narrow-minded people, who are satisfied with
living from day to day and have not the courage to look the social
problems of the time in the face. War will never be abolished any
more than murder. The propaganda should not be directed on that
side. The spirit of conquest is the thing to combat. And this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
colossal error must be fought not in the name of a vague and intangible
fraternity, but by appealing to the egoistic interest of every
one. There will always be wars, because man will never be absolutely
sound-minded. At times passion and folly will prevail over
reason. But the idea that conquest is the quickest means of increasing
prosperity will not be everlasting, because it is utterly false.</p>

<p>Man acts conformably to what seems to be his interest. The
idea he has of this depends on his judgment, which varies every day,
as do also his desires. There is only one efficacious method of effecting
social changes: it is, to modify the desires of men, to bring them
to seek new objects, different from the old ones.</p>

<p>A great many Germans are saying now, "We would give up
the last drop of our blood rather than surrender Alsace-Lorraine."
Why do they say that? Because the possession of the provinces
annexed in 1871 procures them some sort of real or imaginary satisfaction.
But if, on the other hand, this annexation caused them extreme
sufferings, the Germans would say, "We would give up the
last drop of our blood to get rid of Alsace-Lorraine." Now, if the
Germans (or any other people) could comprehend how largely the
spirit of conquest diminishes the sum of their enjoyment, they would
certainly express themselves in language of the latter sort. The
apostles of perpetual peace have therefore taken the wrong road.
Their efforts should bear upon the single object of showing that the
appropriation of a neighbor's territories in no way increases the
welfare of men. The pessimists answer us that it will take many
years for the uselessness of conquests to be accepted. Well, then,
man shall have to continue many years in suffering; that is all there
is of it.</p>

<p>When will the day come that we shall find out that it is no longer
advantageous to seize a neighbor's territory? We do not know. The
only thing we can affirm with absolute certainty is, that when it
arrives our prosperity will be increased five or ten fold.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>This ctesohedonic error (lust for possession) has produced consequences
of which we proceed to speak. Just as individuals fancy
that they will be better off with larger possessions, so peoples imagine
that their prosperity and happiness will be in direct proportion to
the territorial extent of their country. Hence one of the silliest
aberrations of the human mind&mdash;the fatuous idolatry of square miles.
A great many Germans still figure it out that they will have a larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
sum of happiness if their country contains 208,670 square miles instead
of 203,070.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Few errors are more evident. There are thousands
of examples to prove that the welfare of citizens is in no way
a function of the extent of the state. If it were so, Russia would
be the richest country in Europe, while everybody knows it is exactly
the contrary. Taxation in that country is pushed to limits that
might almost be called absurd, and for that reason the extent of the
nation is one of the greatest obstacles to its prosperity.</p>

<p>As an example to illustrate the absurdity of the idolatry of square
miles, take California, which now has 158,360 square miles,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and
1,200,000 inhabitants. If in another century the population should
rise to forty millions, it might be expedient for the good government
of these men to divide the State into several. If the conservatives
of that period should declare that they would give the last drop of
their blood to preserve the unity of their Commonwealth, they would
be afflicted with the square-mile craze, and as foolish as the Europeans.
Territorial divisions are made for men, not men for territorial
divisions. The object enlightened patriots should pursue
is not that a certain geographical extent should be included under
one name or many, but that the divisions should conform to the
aspirations and desires of the citizens. They should impose as little
restraint as possible upon the economical and intellectual progress
of societies.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the province of Rio Grande recently wanted to
secede from Brazil. The Government at Rio Janeiro, afflicted like
other governments by the square-mile craze, would not consent to
it, and hostilities broke out. Suppose the Rio Grandians had been
victorious in this war; what would have been the result? There
would have been eleven states in South America instead of ten.
No modern political theorist would see the presage of an extraordinary
calamity in such an event as that. The new state would have
been recognized by the other powers, and things would have gone on
as before. But if the central Government, respecting the wishes of
the Rio Grandians, had consented to the secession, the empirical
politicians of our time would have affirmed that the world had been
unbalanced. Yet the situation would have been exactly the same
in point of territorial divisions&mdash;eleven independent states instead of
ten. We have then to think that, in the eyes of modern politicians,
the avoidance of a war, the fact of sparing hundreds of millions of
money and thousands of human lives, diminishes wealth, while the
waste of capital and massacres should increase it! It would be hard
to be less logical or more absurd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span></p>

<p>The great North American federation is composed of forty-four
States, of from 1,250 square miles (the size of Rhode Island) to
265,780 square miles (the size of Texas). If one hundred States
should be established to-morrow of about 30,000 square miles each,
there would not necessarily follow either an increase or a diminution
of the welfare of the population. The Americans can make equally
rapid progress whether divided into forty republics or one hundred,
and as slow under one division as under the other. Wealth is not a
function of political divisions. So Europe is now divided into twenty-four
independent states, having from 8 to 2,100,000 square miles of
territory. If it were divided to-morrow into one hundred independent
states of 35,000 square miles each, it would as easily be
poorer as richer. All would depend upon the interior organization of
each of these states, and on the relations which they might establish
with one another.</p>

<p>Very few persons understand this truth. When we see the
most civilized nations of Europe imagining that their welfare depends
on 5,000 or 6,000 square miles more or less, we stand really
stupefied before the persistence of the ancient routines. The
simple disarmament of three military corps would procure ten times
as many benefits for the German people as the possession of Alsace-Lorraine.
In short, as long as the false association between the territorial
extent of a state and its wealth persists its progress in real
wealth will be very slow.</p>

<p>To return to the spirit of conquest. A great many things, as we
have shown in another place, are not appropriable. Foreign territories
are not so for entire nations. A military chief with his staff
may be better off through the conquest of a country, but a nation
never.</p>

<p>When William of Normandy seized England he committed an
act that was not according to his interest as properly understood.
He destroyed by war a considerable quantity of wealth, and he and
his barons in turn suffered by the general diminution of welfare.
These sufferings were, however, infinitesimal and very hard to appreciate.
True views of the nature of wealth were, moreover, not
accessible to the brains of men of the eleventh century. Certainly,
when William and his army had possessed themselves of England
they experienced an increase of wealth that was very evident to them.
The king had more revenue; every Norman soldier got land or a
reward in money, and he became richer after Hastings than he had
ever been before.</p>

<p>But what did the Roman <i>people</i>, for example, gain by the conquest
of the basin of the Mediterranean? Four or five hundred
grand personages divided the provincial lands alienated by the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
among themselves, but what benefit did the masses derive from the
bloody campaigns of the republic? The distribution of the <i>annone</i>,
280 grammes of bread each a day, given to 200,000 persons out of
the 1,500,000 inhabitants of the Eternal City! Surely the Romans
would have gained a great deal more by working themselves than by
pillaging other nations!</p>

<p>Things are exactly the same now. In 1871 twenty-eight persons
received from the Emperor William donations forming a total
of $3,000,000. But what benefit did the German <i>people</i> derive from
the conquest of Alsace-Lorraine? None. Dividing the 3,600,000
acres of that province among the 6,400,000 families that were living
in Germany at the time of the Treaty of Frankfort would make
two and a half acres each. This is not opulence. Of the 5,000,000,000
of francs extorted from France as damage for the expenses
of the war there remained 3,896,250,000 francs, which, divided
among 6,400,000 families, represent a gain of 609 francs, or about
$121.80 per family&mdash;hardly enough to live scantily upon for four
months; and this was the most lucrative war of which history makes
mention! Consider, further, at what amount of sacrifice these $121.80
have been gained. In 1870 the military expenses of the North German
Confederation and the four southern states amounted to
349,000,000 francs a year. They now exceed 795,000,000, and
in another year (from 1894) will exceed 870,000,000. Here, then,
is an increase of 521,000,000 francs, or a charge of 60 francs per
family. As 609 francs, even at five per cent, will only return 30
francs, we have here a clear loss of 30 francs (or $6) a family per year.
It thus appears that the conquest of Alsace-Lorraine would have been
a bad speculation, even if the French indemnity had been distributed
in equal parts among all the German families. But, in fact, it has
not been so; so that the 60 francs of supplementary expenditure
are paid without any compensation.</p>

<p>It might be said that the conquest of Alsace-Lorraine was not
dictated solely by sordid economical considerations. Other interests,
purer and more elevated, stir the hearts of modern nations.
But we ask, Is it grand, noble, and generous to hold unwilling populations
under the yoke? On the contrary, it is most base, vile, and
degrading. It is difficult to comprehend how brutal conquest can
still arouse enthusiasm. Ancient survivals and routines must for
a time have suppressed all our reflective faculties.</p>

<p>Suppose, again, 3,000,000 German soldiers should penetrate
into Russia and should gain a complete victory: how would they
apportion the territory? The parts here would indeed be larger&mdash;Russia
contains 5,471,500,000 acres. But a third of this territory,
at least, is desert; subtracting this, there remain about 3,600,000,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
acres, which, divided among the German families, would give about
5-1/2 acres to each. It may be asked, How will the conquerors take
possession of these lands? If each family delegated only one of
its members, that would suppose an exodus of 6,400,000 men,
going to scatter themselves from the Vistula to the Amoor. What
a disturbance so great an emigration would make in the economical
condition of Germany! Moreover, would every German colonist
be willing to leave his home, his family, his business, and all his
cherished associations, to install himself on the banks of the Volga,
in Siberia, the Caucasus, or Central Asia? He would acquire 5-1/2
acres, more or less, it is true, but is it certain that that would bring
him more than it would take from him? On the other hand, if the
Germans should have their shares administered by agents chosen
from among the natives, what complications, what annoyances
would arise! The Germans might perhaps get rid of these difficulties
by selling their lands. But what price could they command,
with 3,600,000,000 acres all put into the market at once?
Who would buy it? It is only necessary to look at the facts at close
range (besides a mass of difficulties we have not spoken of) to comprehend
that the direct appropriation of the territory of one great
modern nation by individuals of another does not enter into the
domain of realizable things.</p>

<p>The appropriation of the landed properties is therefore chimerical.
The confiscation of personal goods to the profit of the conquerors
also offers insurmountable difficulties. There remain the
public riches. Few countries could pay indemnities of 5,000,000,000
francs. But even that colossal sum becomes absurdly insufficient
when it is equally divided among millions of takers.</p>

<p>All this is most plainly evident, and yet the spirit of conquest
and the fatuous idolatry of square miles are more active than ever in
the old world of Europe.</p>

<p>Let us see now what this mad aberration costs. We will begin
with the direct losses.</p>

<p>A whole continent of our globe, twice as large as the European
continent, having 8,000,000 square miles and 80,000,000 inhabitants&mdash;North
America&mdash;is divided into three political dominions:
Canada, the United States, and Mexico. As none of these countries
covets the territory of the other, there are on this vast continent only
114,453 soldiers and marines, one military man for 700 inhabitants,
while in Europe there is one for 108. The American proportion
would give 514,286 men for all the European armies. As there are
no savage elements in Europe to be restrained by arms, half of the
North American contingent ought to be enough to maintain internal
order there. Europe needs only 300,000 soldiers at most; all the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
are supported in deference to the idolatry for square miles. This additional
military force exceeds 3,300,000 men, and costs 4,508,000,000
francs ($901,600,000) a year. And this is the direct loss entailed
by the spirit of conquest; and yet it is trifling as compared with the
indirect losses.</p>

<p>First, there are 3,300,000 men under the flags. If they were not
soldiers, and were following lucrative occupations and earning only
1,000 francs ($200) a head, they might produce $760,000,000.
The $900,000,000 absorbed now by military expenditures would
bring five per cent if invested in agricultural and industrial enterprises.
This would make another $45,000,000. The twenty-eight
days of the reserves are worth at least $40,000,000. Here, then, is
an absolutely palpable sum of $845,000,000. But what a number
of colossal losses escape all valuation! Capital produces capital. If
$1,800,000,000 were saved every year from military expenses and
poured into industrial enterprises, they would produce benefits beyond
our power to estimate.</p>

<p>To obtain a correct appreciation of the evils derived from the spirit
of conquest, we must take a glance at the past. We need not go back
of the middle ages, from which we shall only take a few examples.
The destruction of wealth wrought by war has been nowhere so
frightful as in Spain. In 1073 the Castilians tried to capture
Toledo from the Moors. With the military engines of the time it was
impossible to accomplish the purpose by a direct attack on a place so
admirably fortified by Nature and man; so the King of Castile,
Alfonso VI, ravaged the country for three successive years, destroyed
the crops, harassed the people and the cattle, and, in short, made a
desert around the old capital of the Visigoths.</p>

<p>From 1110 till 1815&mdash;seven hundred and five years&mdash;there were
two hundred and seventy-two years of war between France and England.
Now the two nations have lived in peace for eighty years, and
it has not prevented them from prospering. What better proof could
we have that all the previous wars were useless?</p>

<p>We need not speak of the massacres of the Thirty Years' War,
by which a third of the population of Germany perished, or of the
frightful hecatombs of Napoleon I, for these facts are in everybody's
memory. We shall confine our attention to the losses caused by the
spirit of conquest, at least since the Thirty Years' War. Here, again,
we shall proceed by analogies. From 1700 to 1815 England expended
175,000,000 francs ($35,000,000) a year for war. Suppose
that the expenditures of the other great powers&mdash;Germany (including
Prussia), Austria, Spain, France, and Russia&mdash;were similar. This
would make, without counting the smaller states, 1,050,000,000
francs ($210,000,000) for all Europe. Still, as war was not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
costly to Russia or Prussia as to England, we will reduce this figure
one fourth. We shall then have, between 1700 and 1815, an annual
expenditure of 787,500,000 francs ($157,500,000).<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Let us estimate
the cost of the wars of the seventeenth century at a slightly lower
sum, putting it at only 500,000,000 francs (or $100,000,000) a year
for all Europe. That would make 41,000,000,000 francs ($8,200,000,000),
or for the entire period from 1618 to 1815, 131,562,500,000
francs ($26,312,500,000).</p>

<p>We have more certain data for the nineteenth century. The
Crimean, Italian, Schleswig-Holstein, and American Wars, and the
war of 1866, cost 46,830,000,000 francs ($9,366,000,000).<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The
war of France cost 15,000,000,000 francs ($3,000,000,000) at the
lowest; that of 1877 at least 4,000,000,000 francs ($800,000,000).
Add for the war of Greek independence, the French and Austrian
expeditions to Spain and Naples, the Polish war of 1830, the Turco-Russian
war of 1828-'29, and the wars of 1848, 3,000,000,000 francs
($600,000,000) more&mdash;a very moderate estimate; we reach a total sum
of 68,830,000,000 francs ($13,766,000,000). None of the extra-European
conflicts are comprised in this figure; neither the war between
Russia and Persia in 1827, that of Mehemet Ali against the
Turks, the struggle against the mountaineers of the Caucasus and
against the Arabs in Algeria, or the English campaign in Afghanistan&mdash;concerning
all of which we have no figures.</p>

<p>Counting only the figures we have been able to obtain, we have
for the period from 1618 till our own days 200,392,000,000 francs
($50,078,500,000) as the bare direct losses by war, which have had
to be defrayed by the budgets of the different European states.
How shall we calculate the indirect losses? Between 1618 and 1648
Germany lost 6,000,000 inhabitants. The destruction of property
was prodigious, the ravages were frightful. How can we represent
them in money? It is absolutely impossible. There are, too, some
expenses arising from the spirit of conquest that almost wholly
escape observation. We shall give only two examples of them.</p>

<p>The ctesohedonic fallacy (lust for possession) raged in the middle
ages between the nearest neighbors. No city could offer any security
unless it was surrounded by strong walls. Since these required great
expenditures, they could not be rebuilt every few days. For this
reason space was greatly economized in the cities, and their streets
were very narrow. At a later period, when security had become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
established, the walls were demolished. In our own time the needs
of hygiene and luxury have urged the opening of broad ways in
the ancient European cities. It has been necessary to buy houses
and demolish them in order to create the grand modern avenues.
There would have been no walls in the middle ages except for the
spirit of conquest, and the broad streets would have been established
then, as has been done in the new cities of Russia and America. To
pierce these new avenues, Paris, for example, has had to contract
debts, the annual interest on which amounts to at least 50,000,000 or
60,000,000 francs ($10,000,000 to $12,000,000). This expense
should be charged to the account of the spirit of conquest. But nobody
has ever thought of attributing these 50,000,000 or 60,000,000 of the
city budget to military waste. And how many other cities are in
the same situation? Another example: during six centuries France
and England were trying to take provinces from one another. Hence
a permanent hostility existed between the two nations. Later on
the circumstances changed, but by virtue of the routine inherent in
the human mind the old resentments remained, though the motive
for them had gone. To thwart the progress of France was considered
a patriotic duty by such English ministers as Lord Palmerston.
In 1855 M. de Lesseps formed a company to construct the Suez
Canal. As M. de Lesseps was a Frenchman, Lord Palmerston and
the British Cabinet thought themselves obligated to oppose his project,
and their opposition cost about 200,000,000 francs ($40,000,000).
The canal might have been constructed then for that sum,
but in consequence of the machinations of the English it cost
400,000,000 francs ($80,000,000). Who has ever thought of charging
that loss to the account of the spirit of conquest? Nevertheless,
that is where it belongs.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The indirect losses of war defy valuation. But the matter may
be looked at from another point of view: that of the profits which
they prevent being made. The American war against secession cost
the treasury of both combatants $7,000,000,000. Now, if, without
speaking of the destruction of property,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> we only consider
the benefits nonrealized, the most moderate estimates make them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
$12,000,000,000 for the year 1890,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and the figure goes on every
year increasing in geometrical progression.</p>

<p>Further, the debts must be considered. The largest proportion
of them are consequences of the idolatry for square miles. This
entails an annual expenditure of $644,800,000 which we should
not have to bear were it not for the ctesohedonic fallacy.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Yet another factor has so far not been mentioned: men. The
wars of the last three centuries have cost, at the lowest figure, 30,000,000
or 40,000,000 victims. Some authors raise this very moderate
estimate to 20,000,000 per century. Without speaking of the
frightful sufferings of these unfortunates, they represent an enormous
capital.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Let us add, further, that these men, if they had not
been killed, might have had children that now have no existence.
Without the wars of Napoleon I and Napoleon III Europe would have
had 45,000,000 more inhabitants than it has, and they might have
been producing $2,700,000 a year.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>We hope the reader will admit, after these considerations, that
the indirect losses of war certainly exceed the direct ones. Still,
adhering to our method of underrating rather than exaggerating,
we will regard them as equal. We may therefore affirm that the
spirit of conquest has cost, since 1618, in the group of European
nations alone, the trifle of $80,156,800,000. Suppose we should go
farther back&mdash;into antiquity even? Imagination refuses to set
down the gigantic sums.</p>

<p>This is not all; the cost of civil wars has to be counted, for
the conquest of power within the state is attended by massacres which
are often not inferior to those of foreign ones. The chiefs of the
Roman legions contending for the empire carried on as bloody and
costly campaigns against their rivals as against the Parthians or the
Germans. The war between Paris and Versailles in 1871 occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
considerable expenditures, not to speak of the indirect losses,
which were immense. We are, unfortunately, absolutely without
data concerning the cost of civil wars, and shall have to satisfy ourselves
with what we have been able to obtain concerning foreign wars.
$80,156,800,000 used up in two centuries! We need not go outside
of this for a solution of the social question. Without this unrestricted
waste the earth would now have ten times more wheat,
sugar, linen, cotton, meat, wool, etc.; there would be ten times as
many houses on the globe, and they would be more spacious, better
warmed, and better ventilated; a network of roads, with frequent
mails, would cover Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. In short,
if conquest had been considered an evil, even during only two centuries,
our wealth would have been infinitely superior to what we
now possess. But if the ctesohedonic fallacy had been seen through
by the civilized societies of the Roman period, the face of the earth
would have been very different from what it is. Our planet would
have been completely appropriated to the satisfaction of our wants.
Waste lands would have been tilled and swamps dried; everywhere
that a drop of water could be made to serve for irrigation it would
have been applied to that use. Magnificent cities, inhabited by
active and industrious populations, would have arisen in numerous
places where now are found only briers and stones. In short, we
should have been able to see men now, in the year of grace 1894,
as we expect to see them in three or four thousand years.</p>

<p>The past can not be changed. We have laid bare the unhappy
consequences of our ancient errors simply in order to show how we
can assure our welfare in the future. As long as the spirit of conquest
rages among men, misery will be the lot of our species. Our
savage and barbarous ancestors did not know what we know. Attila,
Tamerlane, and even Matabele, a chief of our own times, might
be excused for fancying that conquest increases the wealth of the
conquerors; but a Moltke and a Prince Bismarck can not. The
masses are still too deeply imbued with military vainglory. Happily,
they are beginning to open their eyes.&mdash;<i>Translated for the
Popular Science Monthly from the book Les Gaspillages des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s
Modernes</i> (The Wastes of Modern Societies), Paris, 1894.</p>

<h2>A SHORT HISTORY OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUCTION.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By J. NORMAN LOCKYER, K.C.B., F.R.S.</span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>I must come back from this excursion to call your attention to
the year 1845, in which one of the germs of our college first
saw the light.</p>

<p>What was the condition of England in 1845? Her universities
had degenerated into <i>hauts lyc&eacute;es</i>. With regard to the university
teaching, I may state that even as late as the late fifties a senior
wrangler&mdash;I had the story from himself&mdash;came to London from Cambridge
expressly to walk about the streets to study crystals, prisms,
and the like in the optician's windows. Of laboratories in the universities
there were none; of science teaching in the schools there
was none; there was no organization for training science teachers.</p>

<p>If an artisan wished to improve his knowledge he had only the
moribund Mechanics' Institutes to fall back upon.</p>

<p>The nation which then was renowned for its utilization of waste
material products allowed its mental products to remain undeveloped.</p>

<p>There was no minister of instruction, no councilors with a knowledge
of the national scientific needs, no organized secondary or
primary instruction. We lacked then everything that Germany had
equipped herself with in the matter of scientific industries.</p>

<p>Did this matter? Was it more than a mere abstract question of a
want of perfection?</p>

<p>It mattered very much! From all quarters came the cry that the
national industries were being undermined in consequence of the
more complete application of scientific methods to those of other
countries.</p>

<p>The chemical industries were the first to feel this, and because
England was then the seat of most of the large chemical works.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Very few chemists were employed in these chemical works.
There were in cases some so-called chemists at about bricklayer's
wages&mdash;not much of an inducement to study chemistry; even if there
had been practical laboratories, where it could have been properly
learned. Hence, when efficient men were wanted they were got from
abroad&mdash;i.e., from Germany, or the richer English had to go abroad
themselves.</p>

<p>At this time we had, fortunately for us, in England, in very high
place, a German fully educated by all that could be learned at one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
the best-equipped modern German universities, where he studied
both science and the fine arts. I refer to the Prince Consort. From
that year to his death he was the fountain of our English educational
renaissance, drawing to himself men like Playfair, Clark, and De la
Beche; knowing what we lacked, he threw himself into the breach.
This college is one of the many things the nation owes to him. His
service to his adopted country, and the value of the institutions he
helped to inaugurate, are by no means even yet fully recognized, because
those from whom national recognition full and ample should
have come, were, and to a great extent still are, the products of the
old system of middle-age scholasticism which his clear vision recognized
was incapable by itself of coping with the conditions of modern
civilized communities.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1845 that the influence of the Prince Consort
began to be felt. Those who know most of the conditions of science
and art then and now, know best how beneficial that influence was in
both directions; my present purpose, however, has only reference to
science.</p>

<p>The College of Chemistry was founded in 1845, first as a private
institution; the School of Mines was established by the Government
in 1851.</p>

<p>In the next year, in the speech from the throne at the opening of
Parliament, her Majesty spoke as follows: "The advancement of
the fine arts and of practical science will be readily recognized by
you as worthy the attention of a great and enlightened nation. I
have directed that a comprehensive scheme shall be laid before you
having in view the promotion of these objects, toward which I invite
your aid and co-operation."</p>

<p>Strange words these from the lips of an English sovereign!</p>

<p>The Government of this country was made at last to recognize
the great factors of a peaceful nation's prosperity, and to reverse a
policy which has been as disastrous to us as if they had insisted upon
our naval needs being supplied by local effort as they were in Queen
Elizabeth's time.</p>

<p>England has practically lost a century; one need not be a prophet
to foresee that in another century's time our education and our scientific
establishments will be as strongly organized by the British Government
as the navy itself.</p>

<p>As a part of the comprehensive scheme referred to by her Majesty,
the Department of Science and Art was organized in 1853, and
in the amalgamation of the College of Chemistry and the School of
Mines we have the germ of our present institution.</p>

<p>But this was not the only science school founded by the Government.
The Royal School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
was established by the department at the request of the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, "with a view of providing
especially for the education of shipbuilding officers for her Majesty's
service, and promoting the general study of the science of shipbuilding
and naval engineering." It was not limited to persons in
the Queen's service, and it was opened on November 1, 1864. The
present Royal College of Science was built for it and the College of
Chemistry. In 1873 the school was transferred to the Royal Naval
College, Greenwich, and this accident enabled the teaching from
Jermyn Street to be transferred and proper practical instruction to
be given at South Kensington. The Lords of the Admiralty expressed
their entire satisfaction with the manner in which the instruction
had been carried on at South Kensington; and well they
might, for in a memorandum submitted to the Lord President in 1887,
the president and council of the Institute of Naval Architects state:
"When the department dealt with the highest class of education
in naval architecture by assisting in founding and by carrying on
the School of Naval Architecture at South Kensington, the success
which attended their efforts was phenomenal, the great majority of
the rising men in the profession having been educated at that institution."</p>

<p>Here I again point out, both with regard to the School of Mines,
the School of Naval Architecture, and the later Normal School, that
it was stern need that was in question, as in Egypt in old times.</p>

<p>Of the early history of the college I need say nothing after the
addresses of my colleagues, Professors Judd and Roberts-Austen, but I
am anxious to refer to some parts of its present organization and their
effect on our national educational growth in some directions.</p>

<p>It was after 1870 that our institution gradually began to take its
place as a normal school&mdash;that is, that the teaching of teachers formed
an important part of its organization, because in that year the newly
established departments, having found that the great national want
then was teachers of science, began to take steps to secure them. Examinations
had been inaugurated in 1859, but they were for outsiders,
conferring certificates and a money reward on the most competent
teachers tested in this way. These examinations were really
controlled by our school, for Tyndall, Hofmann, Ramsay, Huxley,
and Warington Smyth, the first professors, were also the first examiners.</p>

<p>Very interesting is it to look back at that first year's work, the
first cast of the new educational net. After what I have said about
the condition of chemistry and the establishment of the College of
Chemistry in 1845, you will not be surprised to hear that Dr. Hofmann
was the most favored&mdash;he had forty-four students.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Huxley found one student to tackle his questions, and
he failed.</p>

<p>Professors Ramsay and Warington Smyth had three each, but
the two threes only made five; for both lists were headed by the
name of</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 11em;">Judd, John W.,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Wesleyan Training College,</span><br />
Westminster.</p>

<p>Our present dean was caught in the first haul.</p>

<p>These examinations were continued till 1866, and upward of
six hundred teachers obtained certificates, some of them in several
subjects.</p>

<p>Having secured the teachers, the next thing the department did
was to utilize them. This was done in 1859 by the establishment
of the science classes throughout the country, which are, I think, the
only part of our educational system which even the Germans envy
us. The teaching might go on in schools, attics or cellars, there was
neither age limit nor distinction of sex or creed.</p>

<p>Let me insist upon the fact that from the outset practical work
was encouraged by payments for apparatus, and that latterly the
examinations themselves, in some of the subjects, have been practical.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The number of students under instruction in science classes under
examined in the first year in which local examinations were held was
442; the number in 1897 was 202,496. The number of candidates
examined in the first year in which local examinations were held was
650, who worked 1,000 papers; in 1897 the number was 106,185,
who worked 159,724 papers, chemistry alone sending in 28,891
papers, mathematics 24,764, and physiography 16,879.</p>

<p>The total number of individual students under instruction in
science classes under the department from 1859 to 1897 inclusive
has been, approximately, 2,000,000. Of these about 900,000 came
forward for examination, the total number of papers worked by them
being 3,195,170.</p>

<p>Now why have I brought these statistics before you?</p>

<p>Because from 1861 onward the chief rewards of the successful
students have been scholarships and exhibitions held in this college;
a system adopted in the hope that in this way the numbers of perfectly
trained science teachers might be increased, so that the science
classes throughout the country might go on from strength to
strength.</p>

<p>The royal exhibitions date from 1863, the national scholars from
1884. The free studentships were added later.</p>

<p>The strict connection between the science classes throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
country and our college will be gathered from the following statement,
which refers to the present time:</p>

<p>Twenty-one royal exhibitions&mdash;seven open each year&mdash;four to
the Royal College of Science, London, and three to the Royal College
of Science, Dublin.</p>

<p>Sixty-six national scholarships&mdash;twenty-two open each year&mdash;tenable,
at the option of the holder, at either the Royal College of
Science, London, or the Royal College of Science, Dublin.</p>

<p>Eighteen free studentships&mdash;six open each year&mdash;to the Royal
College of Science, London.</p>

<p>A royal exhibition entitles the holder to free admission to lectures
and laboratories, and to instruction during the course for the associateship&mdash;about
three years&mdash;in the Royal College of Science, London,
or the Royal College of Science, Dublin, with maintenance and
traveling allowances.</p>

<p>A national scholarship entitles the holder to free admission to
lectures and laboratories and to instruction during the course of the
associateship&mdash;about three years&mdash;at either the Royal College of
Science, London, or the Royal College of Science, Dublin, at the
option of the holder, with maintenance and traveling allowances.</p>

<p>A free studentship entitles the holder to free admission to the lectures
and laboratories and to instruction during the course for the
associateship&mdash;about three years&mdash;in the Royal College of Science,
London, but not to any maintenance or traveling allowance.</p>

<p>Besides the above students who have been successful in the examinations
of the science classes, a limited number (usually about
sixty) of teachers, and of students in science classes who intend to
become science teachers, are admitted free for a term or session to the
courses of instruction. They may be called upon to pass an entrance
examination. Of these, there are two categories&mdash;those who come
to learn and those who remain to teach; some of the latter may be
associates.</p>

<p>Besides all these, those holding Whitworth scholarships&mdash;the
award of which is decided by the science examinations&mdash;can, and
some do, spend the year covered by the exhibition at the college.</p>

<p>In this way, then, is the <i>&Eacute;cole Normale</i> side of our institution
built up.</p>

<p>The number of Government students in the college in 1872 was
25; in 1886 it was 113; and in 1897 it was 186.</p>

<p>The total number of students who passed through the college
from 1882-'83 to 1896-'97, inclusive, was 4,145. Of these, 1,966
were Government students. The number who obtained the associateship
of the Royal School of Mines from 1851 to 1881 was 198, of
whom 39 were Government students, and of the Royal College of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
Science and Royal School of Mines from 1882 to 1897 the number
was 525, of whom 323 were Government students. Of this total of
362 Government students 94 were science teachers in training.</p>

<p>With regard to the Whitworth scholarships, which, like the exhibitions,
depend upon success at the yearly examinations throughout
the country, I may state that six have held their scholarships at the
college for at least a part of the scholarship period, and three others
were already associates.</p>

<p>So much for the prizemen we have with us. I next come to the
teachers in training who come to us. The number of teachers in
training who have passed through the college from 1872 to 1897,
inclusive, is about six hundred; on an average they attended about
two years each. The number in the session 1872-'73, when they
were first admitted, was sixteen, the number in 1885-'86 was fifty,
and in 1896-'97 sixty. These have not as a rule taught science
classes previously, but before admission they give an undertaking
that they intend to teach. In the earlier years some did not carry
out this undertaking, doubtless because of the small demand for
teachers of science at that time. But we have changed all that.
With but very few exceptions, all the teachers so trained now at once
begin teaching, and not necessarily in classes under the department.
It is worthy of note, too, that many royal exhibitioners and national
scholars, although under no obligation to do so, also take up science
teaching. It is probable that of all the Government students now
who pass out of the college each year not less than three fourths become
teachers. The total number of teachers of science engaged in
classes under the department alone at the present time is about six
thousand.</p>

<p>I have not yet exhausted what our college does for the national
efforts in aiding the teaching of science.</p>

<p>When you, gentlemen, leave us about the end of June for your
well-earned holidays, a new task falls upon your professors in the
shape of summer courses to teachers of science classes brought up by
the department from all parts of the four kingdoms to profit by the
wealth of apparatus in the college and museum, and the practical
work which it alone renders possible.</p>

<p>The number of science teachers who have thus attended the
summer courses reaches 6,200, but as many of these have attended
more than one course, the number of separate persons is not
so large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Research.</span>&mdash;From time to time balances arise in the scholarship
fund owing to some of the national scholarships or royal exhibitions
being vacated before the full time for which they are tenable has
expired. Scholarships are formed from these balances and awarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
among those students who, having completed the full course of training
for the associateship, desire to study for another year at the college.
<i>It is understood that the fourth year is to be employed in research
in the subject of the associateship.</i></p>

<p>The gaining of one of the Remanet scholarships, not more than
two on the average annually, referred to, furnishes really the only
means by which deserving students are enabled to pursue research
in the college; as, although a professor has the power to nominate a
student to a free place in his laboratory, very few of the most deserving
students are able to avail themselves of the privilege owing
to want of means.</p>

<p>The department only very rarely sends students up as teachers in
training for research work, but only those who intend making teaching
their profession are eligible for these studentships.</p>

<p>I trust that at some future day, when we get our new buildings&mdash;it
is impossible to do more than we do till we get them&mdash;more facilities
for research may be provided, and even an extension of time
allowed for it if necessary. I see no reason why some of the 1851
exhibition scholarships should not be awarded to students of this college,
but to be eligible they must have published a research. Research
should naturally form part of the work of the teachers in training
who are not brought up here merely to effect an economy in the
teaching staff.</p>

<p>Such, then, in brief, are some of our normal-school attributes. I
think any one who knows the facts must acknowledge that the organization
has justified itself not only by what it has done, but also by the
outside activities it has set in motion. It is true that with regard to
the system of examining school candidates by means of papers sent
down from London, the department was anticipated by the College
of Preceptors in 1853, and by Oxford and Cambridge in 1858; but
the action of 1861, when science classes open to everybody, was
copied by Oxford and Cambridge in 1869. The department's
teachers got to work in 1860, but the so-called "University Extension
Movement" dates only from 1873, and only quite recently have
summer courses been started at Oxford and Cambridge.</p>

<p>The chemical and physical laboratories, small though they were
in the department's schools, were in operation long before any practical
work in these subjects was done either at Oxford or Cambridge.
When the college laboratories began, about 1853, they existed practically
alone. From one point of view we should rejoice that they
are now third rate. I think it would be wrong of me not to call your
attention to the tenacity, the foresight, the skill, the unswerving patience,
exhibited by those upon whom has fallen the duty of sailing
the good ship "Scientific Instruction," launched, as I have stated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
out upon a sea which was certain, from the history I have brought
before you, to be full of opposing currents.</p>

<p>I have had a statement prepared showing what the most distinguished
of our old students and of those who have succeeded in the
department's examinations are now doing. The statement shows that
those who have been responsible for our share in the progress of
scientific instruction have no cause to be ashamed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span>&mdash;I have referred previously to the questions of secondary
education and of a true London University, soon, let us hope,
to be realized.</p>

<p>Our college will be the first institution to gain from a proper system
of secondary education, for the reason that scientific studies
gain enormously by the results of literary culture, without which we
can neither learn so thoroughly nor teach so effectively as one could
wish.</p>

<p>To keep a proper mind-balance, engaged as we are here continuously
in scientific thought, literature is essential, as essential as bodily
exercise, and if I may be permitted to give you a little advice, I
should say organize your athletics as students of the college, and
organize your literature as individuals. I do not think you will
gain so much by studying scientific books when away from here
as you will by reading English and foreign classics, including a large
number of works of imagination; and study French and German
also in your holidays by taking short trips abroad.</p>

<p>With regard to the university. If it be properly organized, in
the light of the latest German experience, with complete science and
technical faculties of the highest order, it should certainly insist
upon annexing the School of Mines portion of our institution; the
past history of the school is so creditable that the new university for
its own sake should insist upon such a course. It would be absurd,
in the case of a nation which depends so much on mining and metallurgy,
if these subjects were not taught in the chief national university,
as the University of London must become.</p>

<p>But the London University, like the Paris University, if the little
history of science teaching I have given you is of any value, must
leave our normal college alone, at all events till we have more than
trebled our present supply of science teachers.</p>

<p>But while it would be madness to abolish such an institution as
our normal school, and undesirable if not impossible to graft it on the
new university, our school, like its elder sister in Paris, should be
enabled to gain by each increase in the teaching power of the university.
The students on the scientific side of the Paris school, in
spite of the fact that their studies and researches are looked after by
fourteen professors entitled Ma&icirc;tres de Conf&eacute;rences, attend certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
of the courses at the Sorbonne and the Coll&eacute;ge de France, and this is
one of the reasons why many of the men and researches which have
enriched French science hail from the <i>&Eacute;cole Normale</i>.</p>

<p>One word more. As I have pointed out, the French <i>&Eacute;cole
Normale</i> was the result of a revolution; I may now add that France
since Sedan has been doing, and in a tremendous fashion, what, as
I have told you, Prussia did after Jena. Let us not wait for disastrous
defeats, either on the field of battle or of industry, to develop
to the utmost our scientific establishments and so take our proper and
complete place among the nations.&mdash;<i>Nature.</i></p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE SERIES METHOD: A COMPARISON.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By CHARLOTTE TAYLOR.</span></p>


<p>Broadly speaking, there are two methods which are used for
the teaching of a language: that of the mother and that of the
grammarian. The child learns its own or <i>mother</i> tongue from the
mother; it learns a foreign tongue from a teacher, whose highest
ambition is to be a grammarian. Does the child learn better from
the mother or from the grammarian? Without doubt, from the
mother, according to the mother method. If this is so, must we use
the example of the mother or of the grammarian when we are to
begin the teaching of a foreign language? Is there any reason why
a foreign tongue should be otherwise taught than the mother tongue?
Is it not at least worth the trouble to try the method of the mother,
when it is every day demonstrated that pupils who have had five, six,
seven years of teaching are unable, on leaving school, so much as
to understand when the language they have been studying is used in
conversation?</p>

<p>Let us attempt to obtain light on the differences between these
two principal methods that exist for teaching a language. What is
the mother's method? How does she teach the child to speak? First
let us notice that the mother follows the child: she allows him first to
show interest in something and then helps him to express <i>himself</i>.
Here we must pause to notice that what most interests the child is
not a thing, an object for itself, but the capacity of the thing to do
something, the possibilities of the thing for the performance of an
action. A young child takes a thing in its hand and waves it, or
strikes it against something, or passes it from one hand to the other;
when it is older, it asks invariably, "What for?" The mother names
the thing to the child, and also the action that may be therewith performed.
The child begins to play. Here a specialty of the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
method comes into view. The mother tells the child that she is
<i>pleased</i> or <i>displeased</i> with him, that it makes her <i>happy</i> or <i>unhappy</i>
when the child does this or that, that she <i>thinks</i> he is a good or a
naughty boy, etc.&mdash;all of which remarks express her feelings, her
thoughts, in contradistinction to the actions which have occasioned
these feelings and thoughts; the realm of the mind as opposed to the
world of activity. Let us here notice that the speech of every people
contains these two classifications of words, the objective and the subjective;
and indeed it must be so, since we perform actions and we
judge of our actions. By this method the child learns in about a
year from the time it begins to speak to express itself about what it
does and what it thinks.</p>

<p>Now what is the method of the grammarian? The child learns
first the names of things that do not appeal to his consciousness, for
they do not start from his point of view, but from that of the maker
of a book. He learns lists of words&mdash;that is, he learns to know the
<i>symbol</i>, and not the <i>thing</i>; he translates. He learns about C&aelig;sar's
wars and the book of his father's uncle in what is called an exercise.
For both of these subjects he feels no interest, which is to be
expected, as they are abstract. He sees no action. Of the great part
of language, which may be called the speech of feeling, he also learns
only in the abstract. He reads that C&aelig;sar was glad or that his
father's uncle was angry, but the happiness and the anger are outside
of his consciousness; they have been presented to him by symbols,
that is, printed words. By this method the child learns in about
four years to read fairly well; as a rule, speaking the language is entirely
out of the question. The pupils can not talk of their actions
and their feelings, because these are represented to them by symbols,
for such are printed words; they have not grasped them as actualities.
If on going into a foreign country they are able to understand what
is being said, the teacher may consider himself lucky. He has done
his utmost with the method he has chosen to employ. He has attained
something. It remains true that the mother accomplishes more in
a shorter time than the grammarian.</p>

<p>But is it perhaps possible to put the two methods together, and
thus to create a method which shall contain the good of both? We
must not continue always to act as the mother does, to teach after her
method, or our pupils will continue to talk like a child of two years,
and be furthermore unable to write at all. How shall we manage
to melt the two into one compact, inseparable whole?</p>

<p>Let us imagine a class is to take its first lesson in the foreign
tongue. First, what shall be the matter of the lesson; then, how shall
it be presented? We shall be careful to choose a subject that can
be interesting to the pupil, hence a subject containing activity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
It is not necessary that it should be anything astonishing or unusual.
Let us consider with the pupils how one opens the classroom
door. Let us ask the pupil in his mother tongue how he does
it, carefully drawing his attention to the number of actions necessary
to the accomplishment of our aim, such as walking, standing still,
extending the arm, grasping the knob, etc., together with the resulting
actions on the part of the door, opening, swinging, etc. We will
then draw his attention to the words of activity, the verbs, and tell
him he is going to learn those words in the new language&mdash;say
German. We will now take the first verb necessary to the accomplishment
of our aim, that of walking. We will say, <i>while we walk</i>,
such sentences as "This is gehe," "See how I gehe," "My feet move
when I gehe," etc. We do the same with each verb, always with its
accompanying action. We will take the first four verbs of our subject,
repeat them the first time with many explanatory phrases, the
second time with fewer, the third and last time we shall simply repeat
the verbs "gehe," "stehe still," "strecke aus," "fasse an," always
with the actions. By this time the pupils will know these, they having
heard each one at least seven times. We can now allow them
to recite, we still giving the clew by the production of the appropriate
action. Having taught these first four verbs, we are now ready for
the full sentence "I walk toward the door," "I stand still by the door,"
"I reach out my arm," "I take hold of the knob." We can teach
the subject "ich" without difficulty, as it remains the same in all the
sentences. Let us take the nouns and teach in this manner: "Ich
gehe"&mdash;pointing&mdash;"Th&uuml;r," then a repetition of "Th&uuml;r" contained
in sentences describing it, with at least three repetitions of the word.
Then come the words showing direction and relation. If you say
"Ich gehe"&mdash;pointing&mdash;"Th&uuml;r," the pupil will know that there is
a word lacking, and he will be unsatisfied till he knows it. We
now have a sentence, "Ich gehe nach der Th&uuml;r." We will teach
the other sentences in the same way; we will repeat each sentence
at least three times in its entirety, and we will allow the pupils to
recite. Here it is of interest to show the pupil that the sentence has
sprung from the verb, that the verb is the germ of the sentence.
Whether we do this with the words "verb," "sentence," "germ,"
must depend on the capacity of the class. It is not a question
of words, but of ideas. Let us present our subject as a living thing.
To supply the pupil with an old-fashioned grammar exercise is like
inviting him to make a dinner off papier-mach&eacute; joints and steaks.</p>

<p>All this time we have been considering the part of language
which deals with the <i>outside</i> world. It is now time to consider how
we shall present the part of language which deals with the inner
life. We must make the pupil capable of expressing his states of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
mind, his thoughts, because these thoughts are interesting to him.
There is, broadly speaking, only one situation in class about which his
mind is working: his own success or failure to recite. Hence, before
each recitation we shall speak a sentence of encouragement or command,
such as "Please begin," "I think you are going to do well."
After each recitation we shall speak a sentence of praise or blame,
such as "Very good," "It might have been better." These, as they
can not be expressed by actions, may be translated when necessary
into equivalent phrases in the mother tongue. We shall illustrate
each phrase by stories, riddles, quotations, whatever you like. The
pupil will be interested, and hence will remember. It is not necessary
to the acquisition of knowledge that the pupil should be thoroughly
bored while trying to learn. After a sufficient number of
repetitions of a phrase by the teacher, it will be handed over to the
pupils, who will then address to each other phrases of encouragement,
command, praise, blame, etc. We have now enabled the pupil to express
an action and his thought; the outside and the inside world are
his; he needs only to advance as he began. Each lesson proceeds in
this wise:</p>


<h3>EXAMPLE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Part I.</span>&mdash;Teacher: "We shall learn about opening the door."
General subjective phrase, "Pay attention." Explanation of the
phrase through stories.</p>

<p>Teaching of <i>verbs</i>.</p>

<p>First subjective phrase before recitation, "Please begin." Explanation
through stories.</p>

<p>Recitation.</p>

<p>First subjective phrase after recitation, "Very good." Explanations
through stories.</p>

<p>After the teaching of the <i>sentences</i>, the subjective phrases are
spoken by the pupils.</p>

<p>It lies in the intelligence of the teacher to recognize the moment
for introducing phrases.</p>

<p>The lesson then proceeds to the movements of the door as Part
II, and to our leaving the door as Part III. The scheme is the
same.</p>

<p>All this is a copy (systematized, of course) of the method employed
by the mother. Now, first, can the grammarian be useful to
us? Let us remember that to begin with his method is to put the cart
before the horse. He must play the second but also an important
part. The child learns to speak first, but he also learns to read and
to write. We will give the same lesson to the pupil in printed
form; he will be asked to read it, and then to copy it or write it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
dictation. He will receive the new speech through the sense of
hearing; it will then be communicated to the sight, and then to the
touch. In this manner a class of twenty girls of about thirteen years
had been taught English. After about thirty printed lessons had
been mastered with the anecdotes, riddles, etc., which had occupied
about half a German school year, they were not only able to read and
write without many mistakes, but showed a strong desire to express
themselves in the new tongue, and were, indeed, able to do so very
satisfactorily, as compared with the results obtained by the grammarian
after a seven years' course.</p>

<p>Who first thought of combining the two original methods of
language teaching in this way? A Frenchman, named Fran&ccedil;ois
Gouin. He gave it the name of the "Series Method," because each
lesson contains a series of actions. After the pupil has learned to
express himself in regard to his immediate surroundings he continues
to learn in series in regard to the lives of animals and of plants,
the processes of housekeeping, traveling, trade, etc. It is all presented
simply, but each has its own appropriate words and expressions.
As soon as the pupil has mastered the rudiments he will also
have the subjective matter presented in a series; in one lesson the
teacher will be inclined to mirth, in another to (mock) anger, in another
to hope, in another to (mock) despair.</p>

<p>The most important result of education being the evolution of
the character already present in the child, let us not consider him
a little empty jug to be filled with knowledge; rather let us seek to
draw out the riches of his character. When he is able to <i>live</i> in a
new language, he will be ever broadened, refreshed, and renewed.</p>

<p>This method, resting on a psychological basis, is, with modifications
of manner, which it remains the duty of the teacher to recognize,
just as good for an adult as for a child. Rules of grammar will
be earlier given to the adult, because he will notice correspondences
and differences sooner than the child. But no rule will ever be given
to a pupil of any age till he himself can appreciate its value, till he
is mentally beginning to ask "why?" This questioning state of
mind is one highly to be desired, as it is a state of receptivity.</p>

<h2>THE EARLIEST WRITING IN FRANCE.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By M. GABRIEL DE MORTILLET.</span></p>


<p>The ancient Celts and Gauls of France had no real letters. A
few Celtiberian pieces of money bear characters belonging to
the Ph&#339;nician and Carthaginian alphabets. In Cisalpine Gaul we
find Gallic written in ancient Italian characters. The Greeks, when
they founded Massilia and spread themselves along the Mediterranean
coast of France, brought their language and writing into the
country. The Gauls took advantage of this, and many Gallic inscriptions
in Greek characters occur scattered through the south of
France, among much more numerous inscriptions in the Greek language
and character.</p>

<p>When the Romans came, the Latin alphabet rapidly took the
place of the Greek, and the few Gauls that continued faithful to the
old tongue used Latin characters in engraving the inscriptions they
have left us. Similar changes took place in Gallic pieces of money.
Excepting the Celtiberian coins with their Semitic legends and characters,
which are found only in a very limited district in the southwest
of France, Gallic coins, when they have characters upon them,
may be classified as those with Greek and those with Latin legends.
The former are very abundant in the south of France, and extend,
growing more rare, as we go on into the center and north. Gallic
coins with legends in Roman characters gradually become more
numerous, and were general after the conquest of Gaul by Julius
C&aelig;sar, some of the Gallic populations having only begun to coin
money during the earlier period of the Roman occupation.</p>

<p>There are some evidences of the use of a symbolical and hieroglyphical
writing before alphabetical writing. On some of the
megalithic monuments, principally in Morbihan, stones are found
bearing incised engravings, and sometimes sculptures in relief. Are
the engravings simply ornamental motives, have they a symbolical
meaning, or are they hieroglyphic emblems? Opinions are divided.</p>

<p>The supports of the large and handsome dolmen of the little island
of Gavrinis, Morbihan, are filled with engraved lines running into
one another and conforming to the shape of the stone or to its composition&mdash;all
the siliceous and consequently very hard parts being free
from them. This indicates a simple ornamentation or decoration
executed without any special plan made in advance, according to the
nature and form of the stone worked upon. Yet, among the lines
of the apparently fanciful ornament a number of polished stone
hatchets are very distinctly represented. In all the other dolmens
the carvings are much less numerous and not so close. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
they are distributed around, and sometimes they are isolated.
Among them we remark the frequent repetition of some forms in
groups or singly, which suggest the thought of signs with a determined
sense. Upon a large support of the dolmen of the Petit-Mont
at Arzan (Morbihan) there are at the lower left hand three crosses,
a sign of frequent occurrence on the megalithic carvings. Above
these are two very wide open U's. Seidler sees in these signs letters
of the Libyan alphabet, the cross corresponding to C, and the other
sign to M. Some persons have further thought they could distinguish
an Egyptian letter in the cross. Taking a more general view
of the question, Letourneau<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> has tried to prove that the sculptures
on the megaliths are inscriptions, and the engraved signs correspond
to letters of the ancient alphabets, most probably Semitic. Adrien
de Mortillet answered that the thought of writing involved arrangement,
and no arrangement could be predicated of the signs.</p>

<p>A short time afterward, Adrien de Mortillet, in a paper on the
Figures sculptured on the Megalithic Monuments of France, proved
that the figures are more or less rude designs representing a well-determined
series of objects. Thus the U's, with branches very
widely separated, represent boats, and are emblems of migrations by
sea; the crosses are shipmasters' staffs, or insignia of chiefs similar in
character to bishops' crosses. The polished hatchet is frequently
figured, and often with a handle, and is the emblem of labor, or,
more probably, of combat. The scutcheons, which are also frequent,
are bucklers, or military symbols. They are usually adorned on the
inner side with a variety of symbolical figures variously grouped,
which evidently served as the owner's coat of arms, and are the most
ancient known specimens of the kind, going back to the stone age, or
at least to the transition age from stone to bronze. After that time
the custom of putting their owners' arms upon bucklers spread
widely. It lasted till the end of the middle ages. The painted vases
of classical antiquity furnish numerous and very curious examples of
such marks. The interpretation of the megalithic sculptures may
furnish probable if not certain details concerning an epoch which is
very little known to us. Thus, the scutcheon of the dolmen <i>des
Marchands</i>, containing four series of crosses, one above the other,
and each series divided into two parts, fifty-six crosses in all, may
have been the arms of a chief of a powerful confederation having
fifty-six less important chiefs under his orders. The supposition is
confirmed by the dimensions of the monument and a large handled
hatchet engraved under the tablet between two other crosses.</p>

<p>Near the dolmen <i>des Marchands</i>, and not far from the sea, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
the large tumulus of Marie-Hroeck, which includes a small dolmen
containing rich funerary furnishings. In front of the entrance to
the cavern is a rectangular slab that bears on its face a scutcheon
containing two crosses, symbolical of power, and several very rudely
drawn representations of boats. The engravers of this period were
not artists, but stone-cutters, working upon a very hard rock with
very poor tools. Unable to figure distinctly what they wanted to,
they did the best they could. Handled hatchets were distributed
irregularly all round the scutcheons. Does not this epitaph seem to
mean that the tomb was erected in memory of a powerful maritime
chief by soldiers, his companions in arms?</p>

<p>From these bucklers we pass to generalized feminine representations
characterized by concentric necklaces and pairs of prominent
globular breasts. Such sculptures, which are repeated in various
dolmens and artificial mortuary caves in the valley of the Seine,
may be of religious import. They seem to be replaced in the south
of France by attempts at statues. Of such character are the two
sculptures of the dolmen of Collorgues in Gard, which also have the
symbolical cross on their breasts.</p>

<p>Whatever they may be, the megalithic engravings are the earliest
graphic historical documents of the country. It is therefore important
to collect and preserve them.</p>

<p>They may be divided into simple ornamental motives, which
may further suggest interesting resemblances; figurative engravings
representing known and definite objects and forming commemorative
pictures capable of affording important historical or legendary
hints&mdash;the most ancient documents in our archives; and symbolical
engravings of more difficult determination, and independent of any
alphabet.</p>

<p>Among the specimens of the last class, one sort, the cupule, is
extremely widespread. It is a very regularly shaped hemispherical
cup, generally represented by itself, but sometimes mingled with
other figures, most usually occurring in groups without arrangement,
but very rarely isolated. Entire surfaces are sometimes covered
with this design. It is a very ancient design, as such cupules are
found on the dolmens. In the dolmen of K&eacute;riaval, at Locmariquer,
the lower side of the horizontal slab is starred with numerous cupules,
which antedate the construction of the monument, for they appear
on the parts that rest on the supports. There may also, however, be
more recent cupules. We are totally in the dark as to what they
represent.</p>

<p>Cupules are sometimes cut on the surface of rocks in place. Engravings
similarly cut have been designated sculptures on rocks, and
are found almost everywhere. Those which have been most studied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
and afford the most features of interest for us are on the Scandinavian
coasts, and these have been largely utilized by Adrien de
Mortillet for the determination of the figures of megaliths. We cite
only one example from Gaul, the sculptures in the rocks of the Lago
dei Maraviglie, in a lateral valley on the left, going from San Dalmazo
to Tende, in Piedmont. Some of the walls of the rock there and
large surfaces of detached blocks are covered with extremely rude figures
formed by the accumulation of dints resulting from frequently
repeated blows. Among these figures, which are without order in the
grouping, and in which no regard is paid to proportions, are stags,
rams, human figurines, hatchets, pikes, baskets, and lance points.
These sculptures have been ascribed to the neolithic or the bronze
age; but the existence of figures of similar style on the walls of a lead
mine near Valauri has suggested that they may be more recent.
Human figurines are numerous, but heads of horned animals are
more so. Some are perhaps stags and rams, while bulls and cows are
abundant. The shepherds are accustomed to take their herds and
keep them for two or three months every year in this valley, which
is so lonely and melancholy in aspect that it has been called Vall&eacute;e
d'Enfer, or Hell Valley. It would not be strange if these herdsmen,
for want of something better to do, should have amused themselves
delineating the things that were before their eyes&mdash;the cattle, the
miners, and things appertaining to the mine. As to special traits,
the representations are so badly executed as to leave a wide range
open for interpretation.&mdash;<i>Translated for the Popular Science

<h2>SKETCH OF GABRIEL DE MORTILLET.</h2>


<p>"The &Eacute;cole d'Anthropologie feels with a profound emotion the
loss of the eminent master, one of its glories, whose labors
have contributed in so large a measure to honor and magnify it, and
to extend and confirm its legitimate authority, and who had the exceedingly
rare merit of constituting a science which by means of him
has become a French science&mdash;that of prehistoric arch&aelig;ology."
Such is the eminently fitting tribute spoken by the professors of the
Paris &Eacute;cole d'Anthropologie through their <i>Revue Mensuelle</i> to the
memory of Gabriel de Mortillet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet</span> was born at Meylan,
Is&egrave;re, France, August 29, 1821, and died September 25, 1898. He
began his studies with the Jesuits at Chamb&eacute;ry, and continued them
in Paris at the Museum of Natural History and at the Conservatoire
des Arts et M&eacute;tiers. He was interested in the revolutionary movements
of 1848; and in the insurrectionary demonstration of the 13th
of June, 1849, which followed the presentation by Ledru Rollin, on
the 11th, of a resolution of impeachment against President Louis
Napoleon for repressing the republican movement in Rome, it was
with his help that the eminent deputy was enabled to escape arrest.
In the same year he was condemned for a press offense and took
refuge in Savoy. During his exile he classified the collections of the
Natural History Museum in Geneva; had charge of the arrangement
of the Museum at Annecy in 1854; directed an exploitation of
hydraulic lime in Italy; and served as geological adviser in the construction
of the northern railways of that country. He was also associated
with Agassiz in his studies of the glaciers of Switzerland. He
returned to Paris in 1864, and in 1867 was charged with the organization
of the first hall or prehistoric department of the History of Labor
at the Universal Exposition of 1867. In 1868 he was called to the
Museum of National Antiquities at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where he
continued till 1885. It is specially mentioned that he carried this
institution safely through the perils of the war of 1870-'71. While
engaged in these museum tasks he was struck with the insufficiency
of the then universally accepted paleontological and prehistoric
classifications, and his attention became fully absorbed in the subject.
He held long consultations with Edouard Lartet, the eminent paleontologist
and his learned friends concerning it. As a result of
these deliberations, after careful study of the formations and specimens,
he proposed a scheme of classification in 1869, which was
completed at the congress held in Brussels in 1872, and has become
generally accepted in its fundamentals, after having withstood the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
often-repeated attacks of persistent criticism, and has received confirmation
after confirmation from innumerable discoveries made
throughout the world. "Had his activity concerned only the classification
of the different stone ages," says Dr. Capitan, whose eulogy of
M. de Mortillet we follow most largely in our sketch, "de Mortillet
would for that work alone have been by good right considered a great
man of science. Actually to illuminate a number of dark points, to
group a thousand scattered facts in regular order, to synthesize numerous
isolated researches, to constitute a cohesive theory of them&mdash;that
is what de Mortillet did. Thus he became long ago the uncontested
master, the leader of a school, who was able to group and hold around
him the scientific students and workers of the entire world."</p>

<p>M. de Mortillet was in 1866 one of the founders of the International
Congress of Prehistoric Arch&aelig;ology. He was one of the
first professors in the &Eacute;cole d'Anthropologie founded by Broca in
1875, the greatest achievement, as he writes in the preface to his
<i>Formation de la Nation fran&ccedil;aise</i>, of the Association for the Teaching
of Anthropological Sciences. The school was opened in November,
1875, in a building gratuitously lent it by the &Eacute;cole de M&eacute;decine,
to give instruction free of tuition charges, and was to be maintained
by a fund subscribed by anthropological societies and private
persons, a gift of fifteen hundred dollars a year by M. Wallon for
laboratory purposes, and a grant of twenty-five hundred dollars from
the Municipal Council of Paris for the payment of professors' salaries.
Five courses of lectures were to be delivered, to be increased as the
resources of the association multiplied. The association and the
school were recognized as of public utility by a law of 1889; the
school being the first establishment of private instruction, Dr. Capitan
said in his memorial address, "and up to this time (1897) the
only one that has had that honor, an honor that creates duties for us.
We are under obligation to clarify and extend our teaching." De
Mortillet's work was so true to the sentiment expressed in this sentence
that one of the characteristics attributed to him in the short
biography published in Vaporeau's <i>Dictionnaire Universel des Contemporains</i>
is that he was one of the men who contributed most to the
popularizing of prehistoric studies in France. During the more than
twenty years of his professorship of prehistoric anthropology in the
&Eacute;cole, de Mortillet "gave precious instruction to numerous students,
many of whom, foreigners, have in their turns become masters in their
own countries." He was also president of the Society of Anthropology,
subdirector of the &Eacute;cole d'Anthropologie, president of the
Association for Teaching Anthropological Sciences, and president of
the Commission on Megalithic Monuments&mdash;the various functions
of which offices he filled with remarkable exactness and distinction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
"In all these important positions," says Dr. Capitan in his eulogy,
"de Mortillet unfailingly brought a uniform ardor to his work, a
uniform activity, a clear and acute wit, and a remarkable precision.
He performed his numerous duties almost to the end of his life.
Only last month (July, 1898) he made another journey for the
execution of a mission which the commission on megalithic monuments
had intrusted to him."</p>

<p>In connection with these multifarious labors, M. de Mortillet
published a considerable number of memoirs and of books of the
highest order. He was a transformist from the very first, and performed
all his various researches in the spirit of an evolutionist. His
first publications were on conchology, and numerous memoirs between
1851 and 1862 related to subjects in that branch. During the
same period he contributed many important works on the geology
and mineralogy of Savoy. Among these were the History of the
Land and Fresh-water Mollusks of Savoy and the Basin of Lake
Leman, and a Guide to the Traveler in Savoy. His attention was
afterward more entirely directed to prehistoric arch&aelig;ology and
anthropology, and he published in 1866 a curious Study on the Sign
of the Cross previous to Christianity. Of this period, too, are his
Promenades, or Walks, in the Universal Exposition of 1867, and his
Walks in the Museum of Saint-Germain, 1869. He founded, in
1864, the Recueil, or Collection of Materials for the Positive History
of Man, which was afterward continued at Toulouse by M.E.
Cartailhac. In 1879 he published a work on pottery marks&mdash;<i>Poti&eacute;rs
allobroges, ou les Sigles figulins &eacute;tudi&eacute;s par les M&eacute;thodes
de l'Histoire naturelle</i>. In 1881, in co-operation with his son,
Adrien de Mortillet, as artist, he published a magnificent illustrated
work or album, <i>Le Mus&eacute;e Pr&eacute;historique</i> (The Prehistoric Museum);
and in 1883, the volume <i>Le Pr&eacute;historique</i> (Prehistoric Arch&aelig;ology);
two books which have taken rank as master works. A second edition
of the <i>Pr&eacute;historique</i> appeared in 1885, and at the time of his death
he was preparing a third, in which he was taking great pains to
bring the matter up to the present condition of the science. Another
important work was the <i>Origines de la Chasse et de la P&ecirc;che</i> (Origin
of Hunting and Fishing). A considerable number of memoirs by M.
de Mortillet appeared in various scientific journals, especially in the
two founded by him&mdash;<i>Les Mat&eacute;riaux pour l'Histoire primitive et
naturelle de l'Homme</i>, already mentioned, and <i>L'Homme</i>, which was
established in 1884.</p>

<p>An epoch in M. de Mortillet's life was marked in 1873, when a
discussion took place at the Anthropological Congress, in Lyons, between
him and M. Abel Hovelacque concerning the precursors of
man. The researches of the two masters had already led them, by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
series of observations and deductions, to regard as certain the geological
existence of a being intermediate between man and the
monkey, which they called the <i>Anthropopithecus</i>, and they were
trying to indicate, hypothetically, its leading characteristics.</p>

<p>M. de Mortillet's reasons for believing in the existence of this precursor
of man as a definite being were presented in the <i>Revue
d'Anthropologie</i>, in an article which was translated and published in
the Popular Science Monthly for April, 1879. In this paper the
author summarized the evidence, already copious, in favor of the
existence of Quaternary man, and then took up the question, "Did
there exist in the Tertiary age beings sufficiently intelligent to perform
a part of the acts which are characteristic of man?" He then
reviewed the researches of the Abb&eacute; Bourgeois at Thenay in the
light of a collection of fire-marked flints which he had exhibited at
the International Congress of Prehistoric Arch&aelig;ology and Anthropology
held in Paris in 1867, and deduced from the result that "during
the Middle Tertiary there existed a creature, precursor of man,
an anthropopithecus, which was acquainted with fire, and could make
use of it for splitting flints. It also was able to trim the flint flakes
thus produced, and to convert them into tools. This curious and interesting
discovery for a long time stood alone, and arguments were
even drawn from its isolated position to favor the rejection of it.
Fortunately, another French observer, M.J.B. Rames, has found in
the vicinity of Aurillac (Cantal), in the strata of the upper part of
the Middle Tertiary&mdash;here, too, in company with mastodons and
dinotheriums, though of more recent species than those of Thenay&mdash;flints
which also have been redressed intentionally. In this case,
however, the flints are no longer split by fire, but by tapping. It is
something more than a continuation, it is a development. Among
the few specimens exhibited by M. Rames, whose discoveries are
quite recent, is one which, had it been found on the surface of the
ground, would never have been called in question." The evidence
afforded by these flints was confirmed by a collection of flints from
the Miocene and the Pliocene of the valley of the Tagus shown by
Se&ntilde;or Ribeiro in the same exhibition, a considerable proportion of
which bore evidence of intentional chipping.</p>

<p>Bearing upon this point was a chart of the Pal&aelig;olithic Age in
Gaul, drawn up by M. de Mortillet in 1871, and published in the
<i>Bulletin de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Anthropologie de Paris</i>&mdash;"the only work of
the kind extant"&mdash;in which were recorded five localities in which
occurred supposed traces of man in the Tertiary, forty-one alluvial
deposits in the Quaternary yielding human bones and industrial remains,
and two hundred and seventy-eight caverns containing Quaternary
fauna with traces of prehistoric man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span></p>

<p>M. de Mortillet gave in another form his view of the sort of
creature the hypothetical anthropopithecus should be in a paper on
Tertiary Man, read before the Anthropological Section of the French
Association for the Advancement of Science in 1885, when he said
the question was not to find whether man already existed in the
Tertiary epoch as he exists at the present day. Animals varied from
one geological epoch to another, and the higher the animals the
greater was the variation. It was to be inferred, therefore, that man
would vary more rapidly than the other mammals. The problem
was to discover in the Tertiary period an ancestral form of man a
predecessor of the man of historical times. There were, he affirmed,
unquestionably in the Tertiary strata objects which implied the existence
of an intelligent being&mdash;animals less intelligent than existing
man, but much more intelligent than existing apes. While the skeleton
of this ancestral form of man had not yet been discovered, he
had made himself known to us in the clearest manner by his works.
The general opinion of the meeting after hearing M. de Mortillet's
paper is said to have been that there could be no longer any doubt
of the existence of the supposed ancestral form of man in the Tertiary
period.</p>

<p>The discovery in Java, announced by Dr. Dubois, in 1896, of
fossil remains presenting structural characteristics between those of
man and those of the monkey, to which the name <i>Pithecanthropus
erectus</i> was given, were accepted with hardly a question by M. de
Mortillet and his colleagues as confirming his views.</p>

<p>At a banquet given to M. de Mortillet, May 1, 1884, by a number
of anthropologists, when his portrait was presented to him, the
hall was decorated for the occasion with a life-size picture of an
ancient Gaul, executed according to his latest researches. The man
was represented as having no hair on his body; with very long arms
and very powerful muscles; his feet capable of being used in climbing
trees, but with toes not opposable; his jaw strongly prognathous, but
not at all equal to that of an anthropoid ape; his breadth strongly compressed
laterally and his abdomen prominent; the skin not negroid,
but of our present color; and the expression of his face was about as
intelligent as that of an Australian.</p>

<p>In his <i>Le Pr&eacute;historique</i> M. de Mortillet attempted to determine
how far distant was the epoch when <i>Homo sapiens</i> first appeared on
the earth, by estimating the rate of progression of blocks which were
carried by former ice fields, as he had observed them in Switzerland
with Agassiz. His conclusion was that more than two hundred
thousand years had elapsed since that event.</p>

<p>In 1894 M. de Mortillet proposed in the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Anthropologie
an important reform in chronology. Pointing out the inconvenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
of using several different eras, such as the Foundation of Rome, the
Flight of Mohammed, and the Proclamation of the French Republic,
he suggested that ten thousand years before the Christian era be
adopted as a general starting point. This would include all Egyptian
chronology as known at the present day, and would leave five thousand
years at the disposal of future discoverers.</p>

<p>"A spirit always youthful, a man of progress," says Dr. Capitan
in his eulogy, "our dear master kept himself fully in the current
with all work relating to prehistoric arch&aelig;ology. He knew how
to profit by whatever would contribute to perfect his own work. He
therefore, on different occasions, modified his classification so as to
keep it up to date, realizing that a classification is an admirable instrument
of study, which ought to go through the same evolution as
the science to which it is applied." This high quality of his mind
appears clearly in his last book, published in 1897&mdash;<i>Formation de la
Nation fran&ccedil;aise</i> (Formation of the French Nation). This book
comprised the substance of his lectures of the term 1889-'90. In
publishing it he disavowed all intention of producing a new history
of France. There were enough of these in all shapes and sizes,
written in the most varied styles, with diverse tendencies, and from
the most different points of view, and there were some most excellent
works among them, particularly that of M. Henri Martin, which
seemed to him to contain all the historical information known. But
all these histories, even that of Henri Martin, although he had been
president of the Anthropological Society of Paris, appeared to M.
de Mortillet to be at fault in their starting point. They gave too
much place in their beginnings to the legendary and the imaginary,
and not enough to natural history and pal&aelig;ethnology. It was M. de
Mortillet's purpose to follow an inverse method&mdash;to regard direct observation
alone; and he would rest only on the impartial and precise
discussion of texts and facts. "Texts, documents, and facts," he said,
"become more and more rare as we go back in time. I shall collect
and examine them with the greatest care in order to make our
origins as clear as possible, and to enlarge the scale of our history.
I shall appeal in succession to all the sciences of observation, and
when I have recourse to the texts, I shall subject them to the closest
criticism and the most complete analysis." The texts on which historians
had so far relied did not go back far enough. They told of
events three thousand or, including the Egyptian hieroglyphic texts,
seven thousand years old, but what was this compared with the immense
lapse of time during which man has lived, going back into the
Quaternary epoch? On this vast period the texts furnish no information.
They were, besides, inaccurate, tinged with fable and poetry,
with local and personal prejudice and ignorance, even as to the times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
to which they relate after history is supposed to have come in. If
we want light upon this unrecorded past, we must seek it by the aid
of pal&aelig;ethnological data; and anthropology may be very advantageously
united with pal&aelig;ethnology to furnish valuable instruction concerning
the autochthonic race of France, its development, transformations,
customs, and migrations, and the invasions it suffered in the
most remote antiquity. "With the aid of these two sciences, both
of wholly new origin, we are able to trace the earliest pages of the
history of France." The book begins with a review of what the
texts afford regarding the earlier peoples of France; then brings
forward the evidence yielded by language and the study of the evolution
of writing; next presents the results of research respecting the
precursors of man, the rise and development of industries, societies,
and civilization; and studies the primitive races of perhaps two hundred
and thirty thousand or two hundred and forty thousand years
ago; their mixture with the other races that came in from abroad
and possessed the country; and, finally, the formation of the French
population as we now find it.</p>

<p>M. de Mortillet's relations with his pupils and with his country, and
his private character, are spoken of in the highest terms. For more
than twenty years his lectures at the &Eacute;cole d'Anthropologie, treating
the most various questions respecting prehistoric times, attracted large
and attentive audiences, often including students from abroad, who
afterward became masters of the science in their own countries.
"He was always ready to receive workers in the science, even the
least and humblest, to bestow advice and encouragement upon them,
and to give them the benefit of his experience and extensive erudition,
and for this his pupils and friends lament him." Against his
integrity no suspicion was ever breathed.</p>

<p>In political faith he was always advanced, and ever true to his
convictions. He was <i>maire</i> of Saint-Germain from 1882 to 1888, and
deputy from the department of Seine-et-Oise from 1885 to 1889.</p>

<p>In the observations of the meteoric shower of November 13, 1897, at
Harvard College Observatory, one of the meteors appeared, according to the
calculations, at the height of 406 miles, and disappeared at the height of 43
miles, and at a distance of 196 miles. Another appeared at a height of 182
miles and disappeared at a height of 48 miles, and a distance of 74 miles.
The first meteor was red or orange, or, to Prof. W.H. Pickering, the color
of a sodium flame, and the other white. Both penetrated the atmosphere
to about the same depth, and both were clearly Leonids. These facts go to
show, Professor Pickering thinks, that the difference in color noted is not
due to a mere grazing of our atmosphere in some cases, and a correspondingly
low temperature, but to an actual difference in the chemical composition
of the individual meteors.</p></div>

<h3>THE FOUNDATION OF SOCIOLOGY.</h3>

<p><i>Editor Popular Science Monthly</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: May I be permitted a word of comment
upon your editorial entitled A Borrowed
Foundation, published in the December
number of the Popular Science Monthly?
Whatever my readers and reviewers may
have claimed for me, I myself have never
claimed to be the discoverer of "the consciousness
of kind." Not only Mr. Spencer,
as he and you have shown; not only Hegel,
as Professor Caldwell has shown; but also
nearly every philosophical writer and psychologist
from Plato and Aristotle down to
the present time has more or less clearly recognized
the phenomenon of "the consciousness
of kind," although I do not know that
any one but myself has called it by just this
phrase. The only claim, then, that I put
forward for my own work is that, in a somewhat
systematic way, I have attempted to
use the consciousness of kind as the postulate
of sociology and to interpret more special
social phenomena by means of it. In
other words, I have used it as a "foundation";
and I am not aware that any other
writer on sociology has ever done so. Mr.
Spencer, I feel quite sure, makes no such
claim for himself. The passage which he
and you have quoted is taken from the Principles
of Psychology; it is not repeated in
the Principles of Sociology, where, if it had
been regarded by Mr. Spencer as a "foundation,"
it should have been put forward as the
major premise of social theory. Passing over
the consciousness of kind, Mr. Spencer has
chosen to build his system of sociology in
part upon other psychological inductions, in
part upon a biological analogy. The tables
of the Descriptive Sociology are arranged in
accordance with the organic conception, and
nine and one half chapters of the Inductions
of Sociology in the first volume of the Principles
of Sociology are formulated in terms
of it. Throughout the remaining parts of
the Principles, however, sociological phenomena
are explained in terms of two closely
correlated generalizations that are psychological
in character&mdash;namely, first, the generalization
that "while the fear of the living
becomes the root of the political control, the
fear of the dead becomes the root of religious
control"; and second, the generalization that
militancy and industrialism produce opposite
effects on mind and character, and, through
them, on every form of social organization.
The work that Mr. Spencer has done in elaborating
these explanations is of inestimable
value, but surely it is not an interpretation
of society in terms of the consciousness of
kind. Is it then quite fair to suggest that
the use made of the consciousness of kind in
my own work is a borrowed "foundation"?</p>

<p>However you and Mr. Spencer and my
own readers may answer this question, I can
sincerely subscribe to your affirmation that
there is much more in Mr. Spencer's writings
than most even of his truest admirers and
most diligent readers have ever explored; and
I should be sorry to be regarded as behind
the foremost in appreciation of the great work
which he has accomplished not only for philosophy
in general, but especially for that
branch of knowledge which has engaged my
own interest.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Franklin H. Giddings.</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 5em;"><span class="smcap">New York</span>, <i>December 19, 1898</i>.</span></p>

<p>Professor Giddings, in his Principles of
Sociology, spoke of the "consciousness of
kind" as the "new datum which has been
hitherto sought without success." Mr. Spencer,
on the other hand, showed that this was
not a new datum, inasmuch as he had formulated
it himself in a work published many
years previously. Professor Giddings says
that the passage to which Mr. Spencer referred
occurred in his Principles of Psychology,
and not in his Principles of Sociology,
where, "if it had been regarded by
Mr. Spencer as a foundation, it should have
been put forward as the major premise of
social theory." But Professor Giddings
surely does not forget that Mr. Spencer, in
laying out his system of synthetic philosophy,
made the whole of psychology the
basis of, and immediate preparation for, sociology.
Quite naturally a writer who is
dealing with sociology separately, and not
as part of a philosophical system, will find it
necessary in laying his foundations to fall
back on data furnished by the immediately
underlying science; and this explains why
Professor Giddings makes use in his Principles
of Sociology of a datum which,
whether drawn from Mr. Spencer's Psychology
or not, was at least to be found
there very distinctly expressed. Mr. Spencer
himself says that he regarded it as a
"primary datum," and calls attention to the
fact that he devoted "a dozen pages to tracing
the development of sympathy as a result
of gregariousness." We are quite prepared
to recognize the valuable use which
Professor Giddings has made of the doctrine
in question, and to admit that, by the extensive
development he has given to it, he has
imparted a special character and a special interest
both to his Principles of Sociology
and to his Elements of Sociology noticed
elsewhere.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span> P.S.M.</p>

<h3>EVOLUTION AND EDUCATION AGAIN.</h3>

<p>
<i>Editor Popular Science Monthly</i>:<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: I have not before this acknowledged
your reference to me in a spirited and instructive
editorial that appeared in the December
number of your excellent magazine,
because an immediate reply might have been
taken to indicate a desire, on my part, for a
controversy, which I expressly disclaim; and
besides, I have desired that the public might
read and consider your views dispassionately.
I care but little for the effect upon
myself, if the cause of truth shall be materially
strengthened.</p>

<p>I am not surprised that you refer to me as
"ignorant," "negligible," etc., because it has
for a long time been painfully clear that the
"scientific mind" is exceedingly sensitive,
and while much given to praising forbearance
and kindness, still resorts to language
reasonably regarded as abusive. I have
always found this to be true, and the present
controversy is no exception to the rule. The
"broadly scientific mind" is, alas! too often
narrow and intolerant in treating opposing
views. I do not wish, however, to find fault
with the abuse&mdash;it may prove to be good
discipline, and is, therefore, thankfully accepted;
but I do very much desire to correct
a mistaken inference that you drew from my
reference to Herbert Spencer. There are
some typographical errors in the quotations
that you make, which, however, do not
change the meaning. Allow me then to say
that I have a great regard for Mr. Spencer;
that I have read his writings with much
profit, and that I have never failed to accord
him full credit for the work he has accomplished.
That I can not understand and accept
all his teachings does not lessen my
respect for him.</p>

<p>At the time that I made my informal
talk to the teachers of this city, I had no
thought that my remarks would be published
or would excite public criticism, or that I
would be honored with so distinguished, so
critical an audience, or I should have been
more careful in the use of terms; but it does
seem to me that there is no excuse for the
distorted meaning that you and others have
given to the quotations. I referred to Mr.
Spencer's age to show that we could hope
for no change in his philosophy, and the
criticism that follows, if it may be styled a
criticism at all, is that he has refused to
recognize the Deity, and thereby fails to
"bless, cheer, and comfort suffering humanity."
You discuss it as if I had said that he
had not <i>bettered</i> the condition of his fellows;
but that idea is not in the statement that you
quote at all. The word "suffering" was intended
to apply to those who, by reason of
the misfortunes of this life, are compelled to
look beyond themselves and their surroundings
for comfort, and who in all ages and
among all peoples have turned their thoughts
toward a Divine Being for comfort. I
merely intended to say, in a very mild and
harmless way, that the consolations of a
religion based upon a belief in a Divine
Providence are necessary for <i>suffering</i> humanity,
and my immediate reference to Cardinal
Newman by way of contrast in almost
the same language clearly shows this to be
the true meaning of my remarks. The emphasis
was on the word "suffering," which
was not intended to include more than a
fraction of mankind.</p>

<p>I am obliged to you for your reference to
Mr. Gladstone, who in his last illness illustrated
most fully what I had in my mind.
However great his pain, or cheerless the outlook,
he continually with serene cheerfulness
murmured, "I know that my Redeemer
liveth," and "Our Father," etc. It is perhaps
unnecessary to add that I am sorry that
any one has been led to believe that I underrate
the value of the life and work of Herbert
Spencer.</p>

<p>Please allow me to refer to the statement
in your editorial, "Again dealing with the
modern scientific view, that in the development
of the human individual all antecedent
stages of human development are <i>in a manner</i>
passed through," etc., in order that I
may express my regret that you seem to
vitiate the force of the statement altogether
by the use of the unscientific phrase "in
a manner." The tremendous consequences
growing out of the view make serious and
exact definition and treatment imperative,
and I had hoped that I was entering upon a
helpful discussion of it, but was greatly disappointed.
I am also unwilling to believe
that students of Emerson will be easily convinced
that he looked at life "from a stationary
point of view," but I do not feel that
I can claim your valuable time for a discussion
of this point.</p>

<p>May I trust your forbearance in pointing
out a manifest misconception in your statement,
"We are not imposed upon by childish
imitations of mature virtues"? The remark
indicates that you have not been
brought into immediate association with
school children in a schoolroom, at least in
recent years.</p>

<p>I refer very reluctantly, but I trust without
seeming egotism, to your remarks touching
my election to the position which I hold.
I am innocent of all responsibility in the
matter. I had no "pull" (is the term scientific?).
I wrote to the board declining to be
a candidate. I refused to allow my friends
to speak to the members of the board in my
behalf; I preferred the position (Principal
of the St. Paul High School) which I had
held for years, and I accepted the office with
much hesitation; but the intimation that our
Board of School Inspectors, composed of
business men in every way highly esteemed
by the citizens of St. Paul, and deemed
worthy of all confidence, had been actuated
by unworthy motives, is entirely gratuitous
and out of place in a journal such as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
would have us believe yours to be. Could
there be offered better evidence of haste and
unfairness than this uncalled-for assault
upon those of whom you know absolutely
nothing, and does it not show the scientific
inclination to have theory with or without
facts, but certainly theory?</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">Yours very truly,</span><span style="margin-right: 2em;"><span class="smcap">A.J. Smith</span>,</span><br />
<i>Superintendent of Schools</i>.<br />
<span style="margin-right: 5em;"><span class="smcap">St. Paul, Minn.</span>, <i>January 4, 1899</i>.</span><br />
</p>


<p>We took the report of Superintendent
Smith's address which appeared in the St.
Paul papers. If there were any "typographical
errors" in our quotations, they were not
of our making; and Mr. Smith admits that,
such as they were, they did not affect the
sense. Well, then, we found Mr. Smith
using his position as Superintendent of
Schools to disparage a man whom the scientific
world holds in the highest honor, and
for whom he now tells us he himself has "a
great regard"&mdash;whose writings he has "read
with much profit." We judged the speaker
by his own words, and certainly drew an unfavorable
inference as to his knowledge and
mental breadth. If Mr. Smith did injustice
to himself by speaking in an unguarded
way, or by not fully expressing his meaning,
that was not our fault; and we do not think
we can properly be accused of having lapsed
into abuse. The explanation he offers of his
language regarding Mr. Spencer is wholly
unsatisfactory. He gave his hearers to understand
that there was an "old man" in
London who had devoted all his energies to
creating a system of thought which should
entirely ignore the name of the Deity, and of
whom, after his death, it would not be remembered
that he had "ever performed an
act or said a word that blessed or comforted
or relieved his suffering fellows." The stress,
he now says, should be laid on the word
"suffering." He did not wish to imply that
Mr. Spencer had not bettered the condition
of his fellows generally; he only meant that
he had done nothing for the <i>suffering</i>. On
this we have two remarks to make: First, it
is not usual, when a man is acknowledged to
have given a long lifetime to useful work, to
hold him up to reprobation because he is not
known to have had a special mission to the
"suffering"; and, second, that no man can
be of service to mankind at large without
being of benefit to the suffering. It is
mainly because Mr. Spencer believes so
strongly in the broad virtues of justice and
humanity, has so unbounded a faith in the
efficacy of what may be called a sound social
hygiene, that he has had, comparatively, so
little to say upon the topics which most interest
those who apply themselves specifically,
but not always wisely, to alleviating the
miseries and distresses of humanity.</p>

<p>As to the means by which Mr. Smith obtained
his present position, we know nothing
beyond what he now tells us. We saw his
appointment criticised as an unsuitable one
in the St. Paul papers; and his published
remarks seemed to justify the criticism.
There are "pulls"&mdash;the word is "scientific"
enough for our purpose&mdash;even in school matters;
and it seemed that this was just such a
case as a "pull" would most naturally explain.
We quite accept, however, Superintendent
Smith's statement as to the facts;
and we sincerely trust that the next address
he delivers to his teachers will better justify
his appointment than did the one on which
we felt it a duty to comment.</p>


<h3>EMERSON AND EVOLUTION.</h3>

<p>
<i>Editor Popular Science Monthly</i>:<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: The editorial in the December Popular
Science Monthly on the relations of Emerson
to evolution must have surprised many
of the students of Emerson. A little over
two years ago Moncure D. Conway pointed
out (Open Court, 1896) that soon after his
resignation from the pulpit of the Unitarian
Church with which he was last connected,
Emerson taught zo&ouml;logy, botany, paleontology,
and geology, and that he was a pronounced
evolutionist who used in his lectures
the argument in favor of evolution drawn
from the practical identity of the extremities
of the vertebrates. That Emerson was an
evolutionist of the Goethean type is clear
from most of his essays. In an essay appearing
before the Origin of Species, he wrote
as follows:</p>

<p>"The electric word pronounced by John
Hunter a hundred years ago, <i>arrested and
progressive development</i>, indicating the way
upward from the invisible protoplasm to the
highest organisms, gave the poetic key to Natural
Science, of which the theories of Geoffroy
Saint-Hilaire, of Oken, of Goethe, of
Agassiz and Owen and Darwin in zo&ouml;logy and
botany are the fruits&mdash;a hint whose power is
not exhausted, showing unity and perfect order
in physics.</p>

<p>"The hardest chemist, the severest analyzer,
scornful of all but the driest fact, is
forced to keep the poetic curve of Nature,
and his results are like a myth of Theocritus.
All multiplicity rushes to be resolved into
unity. Anatomy, osteology, exhibit arrested
or progressive ascent in each kind; the lower
pointing to the higher forms, the higher to
the highest, from the fluid in an elastic sac,
from radiate, mollusk, articulate, vertebrate,
up to man; as if the whole animal world
were only a Hunterian museum to exhibit the
genesis of mankind."</p>

<p>The Darwin to whom reference is made
in this essay is not Charles, but his grandfather,
one of the poets of evolution, Erasmus.
The essay also shows the belief in
evolution held by both Owen and Louis
Agassiz before theological timidity made
them unprogressive. The names quoted illustrate
further the factors which influenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
Emerson's thought in regard to evolution.
Saint-Hilaire gave the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> to
Cuvier's fight against evolution. Oken is
one of the great pioneers of evolution.
Goethe shares with Empedocles, Lucretius,
and Erasmus Darwin the great honor of being
a poet of evolution. Of the four, Goethe
was by all odds the greatest. To him, the
doctrine of evolution was of more importance
than the downfall of a despot. The eve of
the Revolution of 1830 found him watching
over the dispute between Cuvier and Saint-Hilaire
with an interest that obscured every
other.</p>

<p>"'Well,' remarked Goethe to Soret,"
(Conversations with Eckermann) "'what do
you think of this great event? The volcano
has burst forth, all in flames, and there are no
more negotiations behind closed doors.' 'A
dreadful affair,' I answered, 'but what else
could be expected under the circumstances,
and with such a ministry, except that it would
end in the expulsion of the present royal
family?' 'We do not seem to understand
each other, my dear friend,' replied Goethe.
'I am not speaking of those people at all;
I am interested in something very different.
I mean the dispute between Cuvier and
Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, which has broken
out in the Academy, and which is of such
great importance to science.' This remark
of Goethe's came upon me so unexpectedly
that I did not know what to say, and my
thoughts for some minutes seemed to have
come to a complete standstill. 'The affair
is of the utmost importance,' he continued,
'and you can not form any idea of what I
felt on receiving the news of the meeting on
the 19th. In Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire we
have now a mighty ally for a long time to
come. But I see also how great the sympathy
of the French scientific world must be
in this affair, for, in spite of a terrible political
excitement, the meeting on the 19th was
attended by a full house. The best of it is,
however, that the synthetic treatment of Nature
introduced into France by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire
can now no longer be stopped. This
matter has now become public through the
discussion in the Academy carried on in
the presence of a large audience; it can
no longer be referred to secret committees
or be settled or suppressed behind closed
doors.'"</p>

<p>It is obvious to any reader of Emerson's
essays that Goethe exercised an enormous influence
over him, and that Emerson was much
more in sympathy with Goethe than was the
fetichistic dualist Carlyle. This influence of
Goethe over Emerson's views of evolution is
clearly evident in the citation already made.</p>

<p>The evolutionary views of Emerson appear
so frequently in his essays that it is astonishing
that he should have been misunderstood.
The citation by the Minneapolis
clergyman from the essay on Nature that
"man is fallen" does not refer to the
Adamic fall, but the degenerating influence
of cities. At the slightest glance, the evolutionary
tendency of this essay on Nature
is evident. In the paragraph immediately
after that containing the reference to fallen
man occurs the following:</p>

<p>"But taking timely warning and leaving
many things unsaid on this topic, let us not
longer omit our homage to the efficient Nature,
<i>natura naturans</i>, the quick cause before
which all forms flee as the driven snows, itself
secret, its works driven before it in
flocks and multitudes (as the ancient represented
Nature by Proteus, a shepherd), and in
indescribable variety. It published itself in
creatures reaching from particles and spicula
through transformation on transformation to
the highest symmetries, arriving at consummate
results without a shock or a leap. A little
heat, that is a little motion, is all that differences
the bald dazzling white and deadly
cold poles of the earth from the prolific tropical
climates. All changes pass without violence
by reason of the two cardinal conditions
of boundless space and boundless time. Geology
has initiated us into the secularity of Nature
and taught us to disuse our school-dame
measure and exchange our Mosaic and Ptolemaic
scheme for her large style. We knew
nothing rightly for want of perspective. Now
we learn what patient ages must round themselves
before the rock is broken and the first
lichen race has disintegrated the thinnest external
plate into soil and opened the door for
the remote flora, fauna, Ceres and Pomona to
come in. How far off yet is the trilobite,
how far the quadruped, how inconceivably
remote is man! All duly arrive, and then
race after race of men. It is a long way
from granite to the oyster; farther yet to
Plato and the preaching of the immortality
of the soul. Yet all must come, as surely as
the first atom has two sides."</p>

<p>It would be useless to multiply citations
along this line to demonstrate not only that
Emerson was an evolutionist, but that his
whole philosophy was pervaded by the doctrine.
It should be remembered that, at the
time Emerson wrote, evolution had won wide
favor among thinkers and that the success of
the Origin of Species was an evidence, not
of the creation of the evolution sentiment by
that work, but of a pre-existing mental current
in favor of evolution.</p>

<h3><i>THE NEW SUPERSTITION.</i></h3>

<p>The death of a prominent man of
letters in the hands of certain
individuals of the "Christian Science"
persuasion has given rise to a
good deal of serious discussion as to
the principles and practices of that
extraordinary sect. That a considerable
number of persons should have
banded themselves together to ignore
medical science, and apply "thought"
as a remedy for all physical ills, has
excited no little alarm and indignation
in various quarters. Some of
the severest criticisms of this outbreak
of irrationality have come
from the religious press, which takes
the ground that, while the Bible
doubtless contains numerous accounts
of miraculous healing, it nevertheless
fully recognizes the efficacy
of material remedies. A "beloved
physician" is credited with the
authorship of one of the gospels and
of the book of Acts. An apostle recommends
a friend to "take a little
wine for his stomach's sake and his
often infirmities." The man who
was attacked by robbers had his
wounds treated in the usual way.
The soothing effect of ointments is
recognized; and the disturbing effects
of undue indulgence in the wine cup
are forcibly described. The peculiar
character of a miracle, it is contended,
lies in the fact that it passes over
natural agencies; but, because these
may be dispensed with by Divine
Power, they are not the less specifically
efficacious in their own place.</p>

<p>These, and such as these, are the
arguments which are urged by the
representatives of orthodox religion
against the new heresy, or, as we
have called it, "the new superstition."
To argue against it on scientific
grounds would be almost too ridiculous.
When people make a denial
of the laws of matter the basis of
their creed, we can only leave them
to work it out with Nature. They
will find that, like all the world, they
are subject to the law of gravitation
and to the laws of chemistry and
physics. If one of them happens to
be run over by a railway train the
usual results will follow; and so of a
multitude of conceivable accidents.
A Christian Scientist who "blows out
the gas" will be asphyxiated just like
anybody else; and if he walks off the
wharf into the water he will require
rescue or resuscitation just as if he
were a plain "Christian" or a plain
"scientist." Like Shylock, he is "fed
with the same food, hurt with the
same weapons, subject to the same
diseases" as the rest of the community; and
little by little the eternal
course of things will chastise his extravagant
fancies into reasonable accord
with facts.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, we have not
much apprehension that the health
of the community will suffer, or the
death rate go up, as the result of this
new craze. On the contrary, we
rather expect that any influence it
may have in these respects will, on
the whole, be for the better; and for
a very simple reason: The laws of
health are not so difficult to master, and, as
every adherent of "Christian
Science" will be anxious to reflect
credit on it by the satisfactory condition
of his or her personal health, we
quite believe that in the new sect
more diseases will be avoided than
incurred. Moreover, the elevated
condition of mind of these enthusiasts
makes in itself for health, so
long as it does not turn to hysteria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
We certainly can not refuse all
sympathy to people who make it a
principle to enjoy good health. Of
course, if they were thoroughly consistent,
they might do mischief in
direct proportion to their numbers.
A "Christian-Science" school board
who did not believe in ventilating or
adequately warming school rooms,
holding that it made no difference
whether the children breathed pure
air or air laden with carbon dioxide
and ptomaines, or whether or not
they were exposed to chills and
draughts, would be about as mischievous
a body of men as could well
be imagined. If "Christian Science"
in the house means an indifference
to the ordinary physical safeguards
of health, it will quickly
make a very evil repute for itself.
But, as we have already said, we do
not anticipate these results. Having
undertaken to avoid and to cure diseases
by "thinking truth," we believe
our friends of the new persuasion
will think enough truth to get
what benefit is to be got from cleanliness,
fresh air, and wholesome food,&mdash;and
that will be quite a quantity.</p>


<h3><i>EMERSON.</i></h3>

<p>We publish on another page a
letter from a correspondent who
thinks that much injustice is done
to Emerson in the remarks we
quoted in our December number
from Mr. J.J. Chapman's recent
volume of essays. What Mr. Chapman
said was, in effect, that Emerson
had not placed himself in line
with the modern doctrine of evolution&mdash;that
he was probably "the last
great writer to look at life from a
stationary standpoint." Mrs. Alexander
says in reply that Emerson
was an evolutionist before Darwin,
having learned the doctrine from
Goethe and made it a fundamental
principle of his philosophy. No one
who has read Mr. Chapman's essay
could think for a moment that there
was any intention on his part to
deal ungenerously or unfairly with
the great writer of whom America
is so justly proud; nor would many
readers be disposed to question his
competence to pronounce a sound
judgment upon his subject. There
must, therefore, it seems to us, be
some way of reconciling the verdict
of Mr. Chapman with the claims set
forth in our correspondent's letter.</p>

<p>The true statement of the case
doubtless is that Emerson received
the doctrine of evolution&mdash;so far as
he received it&mdash;as a poet. He welcomed
the conception of a gradual
unfolding of the universe, and a
gradually higher development of
life; but it dwelt in his mind rather
as a poetical imagination than as a
scientific theory. The consequence
was that he was still able to speak
in the old absolute manner of many
things which the man of science can
only discuss from a relative standpoint.
When, for example, Emerson
says, "All goes to show that the
soul in man is not an organ, but animates
and exercises all the organs;
is not a function, like the power of
memory, of calculation, of comparison,
but uses these as hands and
feet; is not a faculty, but a light;
is not the intellect or the will, but
the master of the intellect and the
will; is the background of our
being in which they lie&mdash;an immensity
not possessed and that
can not be possessed"&mdash;he may be
uttering the sentence of a divine
philosophy, or the deep intuition of
a poet; but he is not speaking the
language of science, nor evincing
any sense of the restrictions which
science might place on such expressions
of opinion. Certainly he is
not at the standpoint of evolution;
and it is very hard to believe that
the views he announces could in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
any way be harmonized with, say,
Mr. Spencer's Principles of Psychology.
Or take such a passage as the
following: "All the facts of the
animal economy&mdash;sex, nutriment,
gestation, birth, growth&mdash;are symbols
of the passage of the world into
the soul of man, to suffer there a
change and reappear a new and
higher fact. He uses forms according
to the life, and not according to
the form. This is true science. The
poet alone knows astronomy, chemistry,
vegetation, and animation, for
he does not stop at these facts, but
employs them as signs. He knows
why the plain or meadow of space
was strewn with those flowers we
call suns and moons and stars; why
the great deep is adorned with animals,
with men, and gods; for in
every word he speaks he rides on
them as the horses of thought."
Now, we should be sorry to crumple
one leaf in the laurel wreath of the
poet; but is there much sense in
saying that he is our only astronomer,
or that he could inform us
why suns and planets were disposed
through space so as to make the
forms we see? We do not think
Goethe held these ideas; if he did,
they were certainly not part of his
evolution philosophy. The doctrine
of evolution is not at war, we trust,
with poetic inspiration; but if it
teaches anything, it teaches that the
world is full of infinite detail, and
that without a certain mastery of
details general views are apt to be
more showy than solid. It also
brings home to the mind very forcibly
that one can only be sure of
carefully verified facts, and, even of
these, ought not to be too sure. It
teaches that time and place and circumstance
are, for all practical purposes,
of the essence of the things
we have to consider; that nothing
is just what it would be if differently
conditioned. There is nothing of
which Emerson discourses with so
much positiveness as the soul, an
entity of which the serious evolutionist
can only speak with all possible
reserve. The evolutionist labors
to construct a psychology; but
Emerson has a psychology ready-made,
and scatters its affirmations
with a liberal hand through every
chapter of his writings. That these
are stimulating in a high degree to
well-disposed minds we should be
sorry to deny. They are a source,
which for many long years will
not run dry, of high thoughts and
noble aspirations. No one has more
worthily or loftily discoursed of the
value of life than has the New England
philosopher; and for this the
world owes him a permanent debt
of gratitude. But he was not an
evolutionist in the modern sense&mdash;that
is, in the scientific sense. If, as
Mr. Chapman says, he was the last
great writer to look at life from
a stationary standpoint, then we
can only add that the old philosophy
had a golden sunset in his
pages.</p>

<h2>Scientific Literature.</h2>


<h3>SPECIAL BOOKS.</h3>

<p>There are a great many different ways of conceiving the science of
society, and until the study of the subject is more advanced than it is as
yet, it would be rash to set up any one method as superior to all others.
All that can reasonably be asked is that the subject should be approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
with a competent knowledge of what has previously been thought and
written in regard to it, that the aspects presented should possess intrinsic
importance, and that the treatment should be scientific. The work which
Professor <i>Giddings</i> has published under the title of <i>Elements of Sociology</i><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
fulfills these conditions entirely, and we consider it, after careful
examination, as admirably adapted to the purpose it is meant to serve&mdash;namely,
as "a text book for colleges and schools." For use in schools&mdash;that
is to say, in secondary schools of the ordinary range&mdash;the treatment
may be a little too elaborate, but for college use we should say that it is, so
far as method is concerned, precisely what is wanted. We do not know
any other work which gives in the same compass so interesting and satisfactory
an analysis of the constitution and development of society, or so
many suggestive views as to the springs of social action and the conditions of
social well-being. Professor Giddings writes in a clear and vigorous style,
and the careful student will notice many passages marked by great felicity
of expression. In a text-book designed to attract the young to a subject
calling for considerable concentration of attention, this is an advantage
that can hardly be overestimated.</p>

<p>In the first chapter the writer gives us his definition of society as "any
group or number of individuals who cultivate acquaintance and mental
agreement&mdash;that is to say, like-mindedness." The unit of investigation in
sociology is declared to be the individual member of society, or, as the
writer calls him, in relation to the investigation in hand, the "socius."
Whether in strict logic the unit of investigation in <i>sociology</i> can be the
individual, even granting, as must be done, that he is born social, is a point
on which we are not fully satisfied. We should be disposed to think that
the study of the individual was rather what Mr. Spencer would call a
"preparation" for sociology than an integral part of the science itself.
From a practical point of view, however, it must be conceded that a treatise
on sociology would begin somewhat abruptly if it did not present in the
first place an adequate description of the "socius," especially setting forth
those qualifications and tendencies which fit and impel him to enter into
relations with other members of the human race. Chapter V of the present
work deals with The Practical Activities of Socii, and shows in an interesting
manner what may be called the lines of approach of individuals
to one another in society. Sometimes the approach is by means of conflict,
and the writer shows how this may be a preparation for peaceful relations
through the insight it gives into opposing points of view. He distinguishes
between primary and secondary conflict&mdash;the first being a struggle in
which one individual violently strives to suppress or subdue an opposing
personality, the second a mere trial of differing opinions and tastes, leading
often to a profitable readjustment of individual standpoints.</p>

<p>Chapter X, entitled The Classes of Socii, is an excellent one. The author
classifies socii with reference (1) to vitality, (2) to personality&mdash;i.e.
personal resource and capacity&mdash;and (3) to social feeling. Under the third
classification he distinguishes (1) the social class, (2) the non-social class,
(3) the pseudo-social class, and (4) the anti-social class. The first of these,
the "social class," is well characterized as follows: "Their distinguishing
characteristic is a consciousness of kind that is wide in its scope and strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
in its intensity. They are sympathetic, friendly, helpful, and always interested
in endeavoring to perfect social relations, to develop the methods of
co-operation, to add to the happiness of mankind by improving the forms
of social pleasure, to preserve the great social institutions of the family and
the state. To this class the entire population turns for help, inspiration,
and leadership, for unselfish loyalty and wise enterprise. It includes all
who in the true sense of the word are philanthropic, all whose self-sacrifice
is directed by sound judgment, all true reformers whose zeal is tempered
by common sense and sober patience, and all those who give expression to
the ideals and aspirations of the community for a larger and better life."
The Pre-eminent Social Class is further discussed in Chapter XII; and the
subsequent chapters, as far as, and including, XIX, describe the processes by
which social results in the balancing of interests, establishment of rights,
assimilation of characters, and general improvement of social conditions,
are realized. The limits which expediency sets to the pursuit of "like-mindedness"
are well shown, and the advantage and necessity for social
progress of free discussion and wide toleration of individual differences are
strongly insisted on. Chapter XX deals with The Early History of
Society, and contains the statement that "from an apelike creature, no
longer perfectly represented in any existing species, the human race is
descended."</p>

<p>The subject of Democracy is well treated in a special chapter (XXIV).
The author is of opinion that, if the natural leaders of society do their
duty, they will wield a moral influence that will give a right direction to
public policy, and secure the continuous advance of the community in prosperity
and true civilization. The "if" is an important one, but the author
has strong hope, in which all his readers will certainly wish to share, that
in the main everything will turn out well.</p>

<p>The remarks on the State in Chapter XXIII are, as far as they go, judicious;
but we could have wished that the author, who we are sure desires
to make his treatise as practically useful as possible, had dwelt somewhat
on the dangers of over-legislation, and had brought into fuller relief than
he has done the difference between state action and voluntary enterprise,
arising from the fact that the former always involves the element of <i>compulsion</i>.
We pass a law when we can not get our neighbor to co-operate
or agree with us in something, and consequently resolve to compel him.
Surely this consideration should suffice to make parsimony the first principle
of legislation. We agree with our author that it is not well to "belittle"
the state (page 214), but it is hardly belittling the state to wish to be
very sparing in our appeals to it for the exercise of coercive power.</p>

<p>We miss also in the work before us such a treatment of the <i>family</i> as
might have been introduced into it with advantage. The family certainly
has an important relation to the individual, and in all civilized countries it
is specially recognized by the state. Mr. Spencer, in the chapter of his
Study of Sociology entitled Preparation in Psychology, has dwelt on the
encroachments of the state on the family; and Mr. Pearson, in his National
Life and Character, published half a dozen years ago, sounded a note of
alarm on the same subject. What position Professor Giddings would have
taken as to the importance of family life and the rights and duties of the
family we do not, of course, know; but we are disposed to think he could
have increased the usefulness and interest of his book by some discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
of these points. We would only further say that, while the book is specially
intended for scholastic use, it is well adapted for general reading, and
that it could not be read carefully by any one without profit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Prof. <i>Wesley Mills</i> holds the opinion that in the present stage of the
study of animal life,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> facts are much more desirable than theories. Experiment
and observation must go on for many years before generalizations will
be worth the making. Putting this belief into practice, he has bred and
reared a large number of animals, making most careful notes on their
physical and mental development, and furnishes in his book, resulting from
these studies, a contribution of unquestionable value to comparative psychology.</p>

<p>In his investigation of the habits of squirrels, he finds the red squirrel,
or chickaree, much more intelligent than the chipmunk. The latter is
easily trapped, but the former profits by experience and is rarely secured a
second time. These little creatures are also adepts in feigning. Two examples
are cited in which squirrels apparently ill recovered rapidly when
left alone and made their escape in vigorous fashion. Many instances of
animals shamming death are judged to be cases of catalepsy induced by excessive
fear. The chickaree is also credited with some musical capacity,
one being observed, when excited, to utter tones that were birdlike;
whence it is concluded "likely that throughout the order <i>Rodentia</i> a genuine
musical appreciation exists, and considerable ability in expressing states
of emotion by vocal forms."</p>

<p>While experimenting with hibernating animals, Professor Mills kept a
woodchuck in confinement five years, and noted that it had a drowsy or
torpid period from November to April. Another specimen subjected to the
same conditions did not hibernate for an hour during the entire season.
Bats began to hibernate at 45&deg; to 40&deg; F., and were so affected by temperature
that they could be worked like a machine by varying it. The woodchuck,
however, was comparatively independent of heat and cold, but very sensitive
to storms. This is found to be true of many wild animals, that they "have
a delicate perception of meteorological conditions, making them wiser than
they know, for they act reflexly."</p>

<p>Some records are given of cases of lethargy among human beings, and
in regard to these, as well as normal sleep and hibernation, it is suggested
that their conditioning and variability throw great light upon the evolution
of function.</p>

<p>In order to observe closely the psychic development of young animals,
Professor Mills raised families of dogs, cats, chickens, rabbits, guinea-pigs,
and pigeons. The data obtained by him, given in the form of diaries with
comparisons and conclusions, constitute Part III, the larger half of the
book, unquestionably first in importance and interest. It is scarcely possible
to overvalue careful studies like these, undertaken not to justify theories,
but to bring to light whatever truths may be apprehended of the nature of
growth and connection of mind and body.</p>

<p>The last division of the book contains the discussions on instinct by
Professors Mills, Lloyd Morgan, Baldwin, and others, first published in
Science. The beginning of the volume, devoted to a general consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
of the subject, consists of papers on methods of study and comparative
psychology which have appeared in various scientific periodicals, including
this magazine.</p>


<h3>GENERAL NOTICES.</h3>

<p>In <i>Four-Footed Americans and their
Kin</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> a similar method is applied by <i>Mabel
Osgood Wright</i> to the study of animals to
that which was followed with reference to
ornithology in Citizen Bird. The subject
is taught in the form of a story, with dramatic
incident and adventure, and miniature
exploration, and the animals are allowed
occasionally to converse and express their
opinions and feelings. The scene of the
action is "Orchard Farm and twenty miles
around." Dr. Hunter and his daughter and
colored "mammy" have returned there to
their home after several years of travel, with
two city youths who have been invited to
spend the summer at the place and are told
the story of the birds. Another family have
come to make an autumn visit, but it is
arranged that they should spend the winter
at the farm. "What they did, and how they
became acquainted with the four-footed
Americans, is told in this story." Most of
the common animals of the United States are
met or described in the course of the party's
wandering, as creatures of life rather than
as in the cold and formal way of treating
museum specimens, and a great deal of the
lore of other branches of natural history is
introduced, as it would naturally come in in
such excursions as were taken. The scientific
accuracy of the book is assured by the participation
of Mr. Frank M. Chapman as editor.
At the end a Ladder for climbing the Family
Tree of the North American Mammals is
furnished in the shape of a table of classification;
and an index of English names is
given. The illustrations, by Ernest Seton
Thompson, give lifelike portraits and attitudes
and are very attractive.</p>

<p><i>St. George Mivart</i>, whose enviable reputation
as a specialist in natural history has
perhaps given some justification for his attempts
at philosophy, has recently published a
new philosophical work entitled <i>The Groundwork
of Science</i><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. It is an effort to work out
the ultimate facts on which our knowledge,
and hence all science, is based. A short
preface and introductory chapter are devoted
to a statement of the aims of the work and
some general remarks regarding the history
of the scientific method. An enumeration of
the sciences and an indication of some of
their logical relations are next given. The
third chapter, entitled The Objects of Science,
is given up chiefly to a refutation of
idealism. The methods of science, its physical,
psychical, and intellectual antecedents,
language and science, causes of scientific
knowledge, and the nature of the groundwork
of science are the special topics of the
remaining chapters. The general scheme of
the inquiry is based on the theory that the
groundwork of science consists of three divisions.
"The laborers who work, the tools
they must employ, and that which constitutes
the field of their labor.... Science is partly
physical and partly psychical.... The
tools are those first principles and universal,
necessary, self-evident truths which lie so
frequently unnoticed in the human intellect,
and which are absolutely indispensable for
valid reasoning.... The nature of the workers
must also be noticed as necessarily affecting
the value of their work.... And, last
of all, a few words must be devoted to the
question whether there is any and, if any,
what foundation underlying the whole groundwork
of science." The result at which the
author arrives is stated as follows: "The
groundwork of science is the work of self-conscious
material organisms making use of
the marvelous first principles which they
possess in exploring all the physical and
psychical phenomena of the universe, which
sense, intuition, and ratiocination can anyhow
reveal to them as real existences, whether
actual or only possible.... The foundation
of science can only be sought in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
reason which evidently to us pervades the
universe, and is that by which our intellect
has been both produced and illumined."</p>

<p>A large amount of information, mainly of
a practical character, has been gathered by
Mr. <i>William J. Clark</i> in his book on <i>Commercial
Cuba</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>&mdash;information, as Mr. Gould
well says in the introduction he has contributed
to the work, covering almost the entire
field of inquiry regarding Cuba and its resources.
The data have been partly gained
from the author's personal observation and
during his travels on the island, and partly
through laborious and painstaking classification
of existing material, collected from
many and diverse sources. The subject is
systematically treated. The first chapter&mdash;How
to Meet the Resident of Cuba&mdash;relates
to the behavior of visitors to the
island, really a considerably more important
matter than it would be in this country, for
the Spaniards are strict in their regard for
correct etiquette. It is natural that a chapter
on the population and its characteristics
and occupations should follow this. Even
more important than correct behavior&mdash;to
any one at least but a Spaniard&mdash;is the subject
of climate and the preservation of
health; and whatever is of moment in relation
to these subjects is given in the chapter
devoted to them. Next the geographical
characteristics of Cuba are described, and the
facilities and methods of transportation and
communication; also social and political
matters, including government, banking, and
commercial finance, and legal and administrative
systems of the past and future. A
chapter is given to Animal and Vegetable
Life, another to Sugar and Tobacco, and
a third to Some General Statistics, after
which the several provinces&mdash;Pinar del Rio,
the city and province of Havana (including
the Isle of Pines), and the provinces of Matanzas,
Santa Clara, Puerto Principe, and
Santiago&mdash;are described in detail, with their
physical characteristics, their agricultural or
mining resources, their various towns, and
whatever else in them is of interest to the
student of economics. A Cuban Business
Directory is given in the appendix.</p>

<p>A Collection of Essays is the modest designation
which Professors <i>J.C. Arthur</i> and <i>D.T. MacDougal</i>
give to the scientific papers included
in their book on <i>Living Plants and their
Properties</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The authors deserve all praise
for having taken the pains without which no
book composed of occasional pieces can be
made complete and symmetrical, to revise
and rewrite the articles, omitting parts "less
relevant in the present connection," and amplifying
others "to meet the demands of continuity,
clearness, and harmony with current
botanical thought." Of the twelve papers,
those on the Special Senses of Plants, Wild
Lettuce, Universality of Consciousness and
Pain, Two Opposing Factors of Increase,
The Right to Live, and Distinction between
Plants and Animals, are by Professor Arthur;
and those on The Development of Irritability,
Mimosa&mdash;a Typical Sensitive Plant, The
Effect of Cold, Chlorophyll and Growth,
Leaves in Spring, Summer, and Autumn, and
the Significance of Color, are by Professor
MacDougal. Based to a large extent on original
investigations or careful studies, they
present many novel thoughts and aspects, and
constitute an acceptable addition to popular
botanical literature.</p>

<p>Having described the great and growing
interest taken in child study, President <i>A.R.
Taylor</i> announces as the principal aim of his
book, <i>The Study of the Child</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> to bring the
subject within the average comprehension of
the teacher and parent. Besides avoiding as
much as possible technical terms and scientific
formulas, the author has made the desire
to announce new principles subservient
to that of assisting his fellow-workers to a
closer relationship with the child. As teachers
and parents generally think it extremely
difficult to pursue the study of the child
without at least a fair understanding of the
elements of psychology, the author intimates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
that they often forget that the study will
give them that very knowledge, and that,
properly pursued, it is the best possible introduction
to psychology in general. Every
chapter in the present book, he says, is an
attempt to organize the knowledge already
possessed by those who know little or nothing
of scientific psychology, and to assist
them to inquiries which will give a clearer
apprehension of the nature and possibilities
of the child. The treatise begins with the
wakening of the child to conscious life
through the senses, the nature and workings
of each of which are described. The bridge
over from the physical to the mental is found
in consciousness, which for the present purpose
is defined as the self knowing its own
states or activities. The idea of identity and
difference arises, symbols are invented or
suggested, and language is made possible.
The features of language peculiar to children
are considered. Muscular or motor control,
the feelings, and the will are treated as
phases or factors in development, and their
functions are defined. The intellect and its
various functions are discussed with considerable
fullness; and chapters on The Self,
Habit, and Character; Children's Instincts
and Plays; Manners and Morals; Normals
and Abnormals; and Stages of Growth, Fatigue
Point, etc., follow. A very satisfactory
bibliography is appended.</p>

<p><i>The Discharge of Electricity through
Gases</i><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> is an expansion of four lectures
given by the author, Prof. <i>J.J. Thomson</i>, of
the University of Cambridge, at Princeton
University in October, 1896. Some results
published between the delivery and printing
of the lectures are added. The author begins
by noticing the contrast between the variety
and complexity of electrical phenomena that
occur when matter is present in the field
with their simplicity when the ether alone is
involved; thus the idea of a charge of electricity,
which is probably in many classes of
phenomena the most prominent idea of all,
need not arise, and in fact does not arise, so
long as we deal with the ether alone. The
questions that occur when we consider the
relation between matter and the electrical
charge carried by it&mdash;such as the state of
the matter when carrying the charge, and the
effect produced on this state when the sign
of the charge is changed&mdash;are regarded as
among the most important in the whole range
of physics. The close connection that exists
between chemical and electrical phenomena
indicates that a knowledge of the relation
between matter and electricity would lead to
an increase of our knowledge of electricity,
and further of that of chemical action, and,
indeed, to an extension of the domain of
electricity over that of chemistry. For the
study of this relation the most promising
course is to begin with that between electricity
and matter in the gaseous or simpler
state; and that is what is undertaken in this
book. The subject is presented under the
three general headings with numerous subheadings
of The Discharge of Electricity
through Gases, Photo Electric Effects, and
Cathode Rays.</p>

<p>For a clear and concise presentation of
the framework of psychology and its basal
truths, the <i>Story of the Mind</i><a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> may be commended.
Although the space afforded is
only that of a bird's-eye view, no skeleton
bristling with technical terms confronts us,
but an attractive and well-furnished structure
with glimpses of various divisions that
tempt us to further examination. The text
is simply and charmingly written, and may
induce many to search the recesses of psychology
who, under a less skillful guide,
would be frightened away. A bibliography
at the end of the volume supplies what other
direction may be needed for more advanced
study. Admirable in construction and treatment
as the book is, there are, however,
paths in which we can not follow where
Professor Baldwin would lead, and in others
that we undertake with him we do not
recognize our surroundings as those he describes.
This is especially the case with the
environment of the genius. We do not
find that "he and society agree in regard
to the fitness of his thoughts," nor that "for
the most part his judgment is <i>at once</i> also
the social judgment." If such were the case,
how would he "wait for recognition," or be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
"muzzled" for expressing his thoughts? In
almost all cases it is the story of Galileo
over again. In art, science, and social reform
he sees far beyond his fellows. Society
can not accept him because it has not the
vision of a genius. He contradicts its judgment
and is fortunate when he escapes with
the name of "crank." The military hero
does not enter into this category: he glorifies
the past rather than the future; he justifies
the multitude in a good opinion of itself and,
is therefore always received.</p>

<p>The first edition of Professor <i>Bolton's
Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals</i><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
was issued in 1885, and was intended
to embrace the principal independent
periodicals of every branch of pure and applied
science, published in all countries from
the rise of this literature to the present time,
with full titles, names of editors, sequence
of series, and other bibliographical details,
arranged on a simple plan convenient for
reference; omitting, with a few exceptions,
serials constituting transactions of learned
societies. In cases where the scientific character
of the journal or its right to be classed
as a periodical was doubtful, and in other
debatable cases, the compiler followed Zuchold's
maxim, that "in a bibliography it is
much better that a book should be found
which is not sought, than that one should be
sought for and not found." The new edition
contains as Part I a reprint from the plates
of the first edition, with such changes necessary
to bring the titles down to date as could
be made without overrunning the plates; and
in Part II additions to the titles of Part I
that could not be inserted in the plates, together
with about 3,600 new titles, bringing
the whole number of titles up to 8,477, together
with addenda, raising this number
to 8,603, minus the numbers 4,955 to 5,000,
which are skipped between the first and
second parts. Chronological tables give the
dates of the publication of each volume of
the periodicals entered. A library check list
shows in what American libraries the periodicals
may be found. Cross-references are
freely introduced. The material for the
work has been gathered from all available
bibliographies, and by personal examination
of the shelves and catalogues of many libraries
in the United States and Europe, and
from responses to circulars sent out by the
Smithsonian Institution. The whole work is
a monument of prodigious labor industriously
and faithfully performed.</p>

<p>In <i>Theories of the Will in the History of
Philosophy</i><a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> a concise account is given by
<i>Archibald Alexander</i> of the development of
the theory of the will from the early days
of Greek thought down to about the middle
of the present century; including, however,
only the theories of the more important
philosophers. In addition to contributing
something to the history of philosophy, it
has been the author's purpose to introduce in
this way a constructive explanation of voluntary
action. The account closes with the
theory of Lotze; since the publication of
which the methods of psychology have been
greatly modified, if not revolutionized, by the
development of the evolutional and physiological
systems of study. The particular
subjects considered are the theories of the
will in the Socratic period, the Stoic and
Epicurean theories; the theories in Christian
theology, in British philosophy from Bacon
to Reid, Continental theories from Descartes
to Leibnitz, and theories in German philosophy
from Kant to Lotze. The author
has tried to avoid obtruding his own opinions,
expressing an individual judgment only
on matters of doubtful interpretation; and
he recognizes that speculation and the introspective
method of studying the will appear
to have almost reached their limits.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Frank Overton's</i> text-book of <i>Applied
Physiology</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> makes a new departure
from the old methods of teaching physiology,
in that it begins with the cells as the units
of life and shows their relations to all the
elements of the body and all the processes
of human action. The fact of their fundamental
nature and importance is emphasized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
throughout. The relation of oxidation&mdash;oxidation
within the cells&mdash;as the essential
act of respiration&mdash;to the disappearance of
food, the production of waste matters, and
the development of force, is dwelt upon.
The influence of alcohol is discussed in all
its aspects, not in a separate chapter, but
whenever it comes in place in connection
with the several topics and subjects treated.
Other narcotics are dealt with. A chapter
on inflammation and taking cold is believed
to be an entirely new feature in a school
text book. Summaries and review topics
are arranged at the end of each chapter;
subjects from original demonstrations and
the use of the microscope are listed; and
many hygienic topics, such as air, ventilation,
drinking water, clothing, bathing, bacteria,
etc., are specially treated.</p>

<p>The prominent characteristic of Professors
<i>F.P. Venable</i> and <i>J.L. Howe's</i> text-book
on <i>Inorganic Chemistry according to
the Periodic Law</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> is expressed in the title,
and is the adoption of the periodic law as
the guiding principle of the treatment, and
the keeping of it in the foreground throughout.
So far as the authors have noticed, the
complete introduction of this system has not
been attempted before in any text book.
They have made the experiment of following
it closely in their classes, and their success
through several years has convinced them
of its value. "In no other way have we
been able to secure such thorough results,
both as to thorough, systematic instruction
and economy of time. The task is rendered
easier for both student and teacher." After
the setting forth of definitions and general
principles in the introduction, the elements
are taken up and described according to their
places and relations in the periodic groups,
and then their compounds are described successively,
with hydrogen, the halogens, oxygen,
sulphur, and the nitrides, phosphides,
carbides, silicides, and the alloys. The treatment
is systematic, condensed, and clear.</p>

<p>The purpose of Mr. <i>John W. Troeger's</i>
series of Nature-Study Readers is declared by
the editor to be to supply supplementary reading
for pupils who have been two years or
more at school. They are composed, moreover,
with a view to facilitating the recognition
in the printed form of words already
familiar to the ear, and to making the child at
home with them. In carrying out this purpose
the author takes advantage of the child's
fondness for making observations, especially
when attended by his companions or elders.
In doing this the aim has been kept in view
not to weary the child with details, and yet
to give sufficient information to lead to accurate
and complete observations. Most of the
chapters in the present volume, <i>Harold's
Rambles</i>, the second of the series, contain
the information gleaned during walks and
short excursions. Among the subjects concerned
are birds, mammals, insects, earthworms,
snails, astronomy, minerals, plants,
grasses, vegetables, physics, and features
connected with the farm. These Nature-study
readers are published as a branch of
Appletons' Home-Reading series. (New York:
D. Appleton and Company. Price, 40 cents.)</p>

<p>Another of Appletons' Home-Reading
Books is <i>News from the Birds</i>, which the
author, <i>Leander S. Keyser</i>, explains has been
written with two purposes in mind: first, to
furnish actual instruction, to tell some new
facts about bird life that have not yet been
recited; and, second, to inspire in readers a
taste for Nature study. It is by no means a
key for the identification of the birds; but,
instead of telling all that is or may be known
respecting a particular bird, the author has
sought only to recite such incidents as will
spur the reader to go out into the fields and
woods and study the birds in their native
haunts. For the most part the author has
given a record of his own observations, and
not a reiteration of what others have said.
He has gone to the birds themselves for his
facts, and has made very little use of books.</p>

<p>It has been Mr. <i>Ernest A. Congdon's</i> aim,
in preparing his <i>Brief Course in Qualitative
Analysis</i> (New York: Henry Holt; 60 cents),
to render it as concise as possible while making
the least sacrifice of a study of reactions
and solubilities of chemical importance. The
manual covers the points of preliminary reactions
on bases and acids; schemes of analysis
for bases and acids; explanatory notes
on the analyses; treatment of solid substances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
(powders, alloys, or metals); and tables of
solubilities of salts of the bases studied.
A comprehensive list of questions, stimulative
of thought, is appended. The book is
intended merely as a laboratory guide, and
should be supplemented by frequent "quiz
classes" and by constant personal attention.
The course has been satisfactorily given in
the Drexel Institute within the allotted time
of one laboratory period of four hours, and
one hour for a lecture or quiz per week, during
the school year of thirty-two weeks.</p>

<p><i>Lest we Forget</i> is the title which President
<i>David Starr Jordan</i> has given to his
address before the graduating class of Leland
Stanford Junior University, May 25, 1898&mdash;"lest
we forget" the dangers and duties and
responsibilities laid upon us by the war with
Spain. Though delivered before the "policy
of expansion" was fully developed, the address
describes with prophetic accuracy the
dream of imperialism with which the minds
even of men usually sane and honest have
become infected, and points out a few of
the logical results to which they would lead,
and the dangers which will have to be incurred
in gratifying them. We cite a few
of the strong points made by the author:
"Our question is not what we shall do with
Cuba, Porto Rico, and the Philippines; it is
what these prizes will do to us." "Shall
the war for Cuba Libre come to an inglorious
end? If we make anything by it, it will be
most inglorious." "I believe that the movement
toward broad dominion, so eloquently
outlined by Mr. Olney, would be a step downward."</p>

<h2>Fragments of Science.</h2>


<p><b>Early Submarine Telegraphy.</b>&mdash;The actual
date of the beginning of subaqueous telegraphy
was admitted by Professor Ayrtoun,
in a lecture delivered before the Imperial
Institute in 1897, to be uncertain. Baron
Schilling is said to have exploded mines under
the Neva by means of the electric current
as early as 1812; and this method was
used by Colonel Pasley to blow up the wreck
of the Royal George at Spithead in 1838;
but our Morse has the credit of having first
used a wire insulated with India rubber under
water. In 1837, Wheatstone and Cooke
were experimenting with land telegraphy,
and were considering the possibility of laying
an insulated wire under water. Morse's
successful experiments date from 1842,
when he personally laid a cable between
Castle Garden and Governor's Island and
sent messages over it; the next morning it
was broken. With the introduction of gutta
percha as an insulator in 1847, submarine
telegraphy became practicable. The Central
Oceanic Telegraph Company had been
registered by Jacob Brett in 1845, and a
cable was laid under the English Channel by
Brett and his brother in 1850. Messages
were sent through it, but, like Morse's earlier
effort, it immediately became silent.
Better success attended the cable of the
next year, which was sheathed with iron;
and the first public submarine message was
sent over it November 13, 1851. Morse
wrote of the possibility of establishing electro-magnetic
communication across the ocean
as early as 1844. A syndicate was formed
for this purpose in 1855, Cyrus W. Field
being the most conspicuous figure in it. An
understanding was reached with the Brett
company, and the Atlantic Telegraph Company
was formed. The first effort to lay the
cable was made in 1857 by the United
States frigate Niagara and H.M.S. Agamemnon,
but the wires broke in deep water
when about a third of the work was done.
A cable was successfully laid the next year,
but it died out in a month. Finally, electric
communication was permanently established
across the Atlantic by the Telegraph Construction
and Maintenance Company, which,
capturing a cable that had been lost, soon
had two. Transatlantic cables have now
become so numerous and so regular in their
working that the danger of even a temporary
failure has become very remote.</p>

<p><b>The White Lady Mountain.</b>&mdash;Iztaccihuatl
(pronounced Is-tak-see-watl) is about ten
miles, measuring to its principal peak, north
of Popocatepetl. In shape it consists of a
long, narrow ridge cut into three well-defined
peaks about equally distant from one
another, of which the central is the highest;
and the snow-covered peak resembles the
figure of a woman lying on her back; whence
the name of the mountain, which means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
<i>white woman</i>. According to the Aztecs, Dr.
O.C. Farrington, of the Field Columbian
Museum, tells us, this woman was a goddess
who for some crime had been struck dead
and doomed to lie forever on this spot.
Popocatepetl was her lover, and had stood
by her. Tastes differ as to whether it or
Popocatepetl presents a more striking view,
but either is a beautiful enough object to
look upon. The first authenticated record of
an ascent to the summit of the mountain is
that of Mr. H. Reniere Whitehouse, who
reached the top November 9, 1889, and found
there undoubted evidence that an ascent had
been made five days previously by Mr. James
de Salis. Prof. Angelo Heilprin and Mr. F.
C. Baker attempted an ascent in the following
April, but were turned back when about
seventy-five yards below the summit, at a
height of 16,730 feet, by two impassable
crevasses. "The ascent of Iztaccihuatl
seems, therefore, pretty generally to have
foiled those who have attempted it. Dr.
Farrington, who ascended to the Porfirio
Diaz Glacier in February, 1896, describes
the route as steeper than that which leads up
to Popocatepetl." The brilliant and varied
flora, picturesque barrenness, and beautiful
cascades lend everywhere a charm to the
scene which contrasts favorably with the
somber monotony which characterizes the
route by which Popocatepetl is ascended.
The slopes of the mountain are cultivated
to a considerable height&mdash;10,860 feet. The
lower slopes are largely covered with soil,
and the andesite rock, of gray and red colors,
differs completely in character from that
of Popocatepetl. The aiguillelike character
of many of the spurs extending at right
angles to the course of the mountain is a
prominent feature. Many caves in the rock
furnish shelter to cattle and persons attempting
the ascent. Dr. Farrington examined
the Porfirio Diaz Glacier, and concluded that
it formerly had a much greater extent than
now.</p>

<p><b>The Adulteration of Butter with Glucose.</b>&mdash;The
following is from an article by C.A.
Crampton in the Journal of the American
Chemical Society: In domestic practice the
addition of sugar to butter for purposes of
preservation is doubtless almost as old as
the art of butter-making itself; salt, however,
is the usually preferred preservative.
Sugar appears in several of the various
United States patents for so-called "improving"
or renovating processes for butter, being
added to it along with salt, saltpeter, and
in some cases sodium carbonate. Within
the past few years glucose has been used in
butter specially prepared for export to tropical
countries, as the West Indies or South
America. It is usually put up in tins, and
various means are resorted to for preventing
the decomposition of their goods before they
reach the consumer. Very large quantities
of salt are used by the French exporters, as
the following two analyses show:</p>

<p>Chemical antiseptics, borax, salicylic acid,
etc., are sometimes used, but the method
found most efficacious by exporters in this
country seems to be the use of glucose in
conjunction with moderately heavy salting.
The glucose used is a heavy, low-converted
sirup, known as confectioners' glucose. The
detection of glucose in butter presents no
difficulty. The butter is thoroughly washed
with hot water, which will readily take up
whatever glucose is present. This solution
is then tested by means of Fehling's solution.
The following is an analysis of the so-called
<i>beurre rouge</i>, or red butter, which is exported
to Guadeloupe. It is a peculiar highly colored
compound, containing large quantities
of salt and glucose:</p>

<p><b>Decorated Skulls and the Power ascribed
to them.</b>&mdash;A collection of sixteen
skulls&mdash;eight of men, seven of women, and
one of a child&mdash;from New Guinea, is described
by George A. Dorsey in the publications
of the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago.
They were received from a native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
chief, who used them for the adornment of
his house, and is said to have prized them as
trophies of war. They are decorated in the
frontal region by engraved designs, and the
parts are attached to one another by very
skillfully adjusted cords. The ornamentation
and the bindings are the subject of
a special comment by William H. Holmes.
Importance is attached by natives of New
Guinea to the preservation of the skulls of
friends as mementoes and of foes as trophies,
and of both categories on account of the
virtue&mdash;the best qualities of the individuals
whose skulls they are&mdash;which they are supposed
to impart in some mysterious way to
their possessor. Hence special care is taken
to have them preserved in detail, and that no
part be lost. In the present specimens the
jaws were secured by fastenings at right and
left and in front. The teeth were carefully
tied in, and when lost were replaced by artificial
teeth. A cord was fastened around the
back molar on one side, and carried along,
inclosing each tooth in turn, in a loop, so as
to make a very effective fastening when the
cord was tightly drawn and attached to the
back molar on the other side. The lower
jaw was very firmly fastened to the skull by
closely wrapped cords tightened by binding
the strands around the middle portion. In
some cases these fastenings are very elaborate
and neat; in others, imperfect and slovenly.
All the skulls in the collection are
decorated with designs engraved on the
frontal bone, and in some cases the figures
run back. The execution of the work is not
of a very high order, but is rather irregular
and scratchy. Nearly all embody easily distinguished
animal forms, and the more formal
or nearly geometric ones are probably
animal derivatives or representations of
land, water, or natural phenomena. They
are possibly totemic or mythological.</p>

<p><b>Galax and its Affinities.</b>&mdash;One of the
most interesting plants of the Southern
mountain region is the galax (<i>Galax
aphylla</i>), which grows in the highlands
more or less abundantly from Virginia
southward. The slopes of Grandfather
Mountain, North Carolina, are carpeted with
it for many square miles of almost uninterrupted
extent. Besides being an attractive
plant at home, its thick, leathery, rounded
cordate leaves, deep green or crimson or
mixed, according to the season, make it
much in demand for decoration, and tons of
it in the aggregate are shipped, from places
where it grows abundantly, for that purpose.
Its affiliations with certain other Alpine
and arctic plants are described in a carefully
studied paper on the Order Diapensisce&aelig;,
published by Margaret Farsman
Boynton in the Journal of the National
Science Club, Washington. Linn&aelig;us found
in Lapland a creeping evergreen herb, matting
the surface with its stiff, spatulate
leaves, and described it in 1737 as <i>Diapensia
lapponica</i>. Then galax was discovered by
Gronovius and given a place by Linn&aelig;us&mdash;because
of its stamens rather than of its
natural affinities&mdash;along with Diapensia. Michaux,
in the last decade of the eighteenth
century, found <i>Pyxidanthera barbulata</i>, resembling
diapensia, in the pine barrens of
New Jersey and North Carolina. More recently
other species of diapensia and <i>Berneuxia</i>
have been found among the Himalayas,
and <i>Schizocodon</i> of several species in
Japan. One of the most remarkable discoveries
in the list was that by Michaux in
the mountains of North Carolina of a plant
which was afterward called <i>Shortia galacifolia</i>,
from the resemblance of its leaves to
those of galax. This plant in a living state
was then lost, and when Gray and Torrey
looked for it in 1831 in vain, only one preserved
specimen of it was known to be extant
and that in fruit; and it was not till
1877 that it was collected, rediscovered, in
fact, in flower, as Gray has said, "by an
herbalist almost absolutely ignorant of botany,
who was only informed of his good fortune
on sending to a botanist one of the two
specimens collected by him." The Shortia,
so far as is known, grows only in a very narrow
district, and those who know the place
are careful not to direct the public to it.
Specimens have been collected by a few
nurserymen, who cultivate it and have it for
sale. The plants of this list are variously
classified as among one another by botanists,
but are regarded as belonging to a common
group. "The real story of their development,"
says the author of the paper, "can be
gathered only in hints from their present
distribution, for unfortunately they have
neither gallery of ancestral portraits nor recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
geological tree." But their ancestors
are supposed to have been pushed down by
the glaciers and left where the modern
forms are found. Almost anywhere in the
boreal flora <i>Diapensia lapponica</i> may be
found, whether in northern Asia, or Europe,
or America, or even on the mountains of
Labrador and in the Pyrenees, the Scotch
mountains, and our own White Mountains.</p>

<p><b>The Academy della Crusca.</b>&mdash;"For three
hundred years," says a correspondent of the
London Athen&aelig;um, "the learned body, the
Academy of la Crusca (the bran), Florence,
has been scrupulously sifting the Italian
tongue and producing successive editions of
its monumental dictionary. Its present seat
is in the monastery of St. Mark&mdash;Savonarola's
cloister&mdash;where it occupies the hall behind
the great library. When an associate is
promoted to full membership, his official reception
is still accompanied by the traditional
rite. First, he is solemnly conducted
to the Cruscan museum, and left to solitary
meditation among shovel-backed chairs surmounted
by the symbolical sieve and bookcases
ingeniously fashioned in the likeness
of corn sacks. The walls are covered with
the names, crests, and mottoes of former
members, who in past times usually assumed
fantastic titles descriptive of the academy's
labors." Some of these printed inscriptions
and comical devices are more or less quaint.
Thus, Dr. Giulio Maxi in 1590 took the name
of <i>Il Fiorito</i>, or the flowery one, with the
device of a basket of wheat in bloom and
the motto from Petrarch (translation):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I enjoy the present and hope for better."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 1641 the Senator Vieri appeared as <i>Le
Svanito</i>, the evaporated, with an uncorked
wine flask, the stopper beside it, and the
motto:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, how I long for the medicine!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 1660 the Marquis Malaskini adopted the
title of <i>Il Preservato</i>, the preserved, the device
of olives packed in straw, and the motto
from Petrarch:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Keep the prize green."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 1764, the Abbot Giuseppe Pelli, surnamed
<i>Il Megliorato</i>, the improved, took the device
of a newly invented sieve for the better sifting
of grain, with the Petrarchian motto:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Follow the few, and not the throng."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In 1770, Signor Domenico Manni assumed
the title of <i>Il Sofferente</i>, the sufferer, with a
straw chair as his device, and a motto from
Dante:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The master said that lying in a feather bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One would not come to fame&mdash;nor under the plowshare."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In due time the new member is escorted to
the hall where the academy is assembled, and
the chief consul, head of the academy, greets
him with a speech, to which he has to make
a fitting reply. Historical Italian families
are numerously represented on the academy's
rolls, and among the foreign members are
the names of William Roscoe and Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<p><b>Aboriginal Superstitions about Bones.</b>&mdash;A
very interesting archaeological site in
Mexico, visited by Carl Lumholtz and Ale&#353;
Hedli&#269;ka in the fall of 1896, is near Zac&aacute;pu,
in the State of Michoacan. The region is
marked by many stone mounds on or near
the edge of the old flow of lava, extending
for several miles; and directly above the
village stands a large stone fortress, called
El Palacio. Excavating near this fortress,
Mr. Lumholtz unearthed several skeletons,
which had been buried without any order,
and accompanied by "remarkably few objects,"
but some of these were well worthy
of study. The most curious things found
were some bones, strangely marked with
grooves across them, exhibiting a little variety
in arrangement, but all similarly executed,
and evidently after a carefully devised
system. This feature is so far unique in
arch&aelig;ology, and its purpose can as yet be
only a matter of conjecture. Two ways are
proposed by the author of explaining it. The
marking may have been an operation undertaken
for the purpose of dispatching the
dead. Mr. Lumholtz is knowing to a belief
among the tribes of Mexico that the dead
are troublesome to the survivors for at least
one year, and certain ceremonies and feasts
in regard to them have to be observed in
order to prevent them from doing harm, and
to drive them away. The Tarahumares
guard their beer against them, and others
provide a special altar with food for the
dead on it at their rain-making feasts, else
the spirits would work some mischief.
Among many tribes an offering is made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
the dead, before drinking brandy, of a few
drops of the liquor. A relation is also supposed
to exist between disease and pain and
the bones of the deceased person. A whole
class of diseases are supposed to have their
seat in the bones or the marrow of them.
If the disease does not yield to the shaman's
efforts, and causes death, the Indians think
that the pain will continue after death and
vex the ghost, making him malignant and
troublesome. Therefore the pain must be
conquered, and driven away from the bones
and the marrow. Hence the markings may
have been made in order to sever all connection
between the spirit and his former life,
and from the disease that caused his death.
The other explanation is that the bones were
taken from slain enemies for other purposes
than as mere trophies. Personal or bodily
relics are supposed to possess some of the
qualities of the deceased, and to give power.
This view is supported by some observations
of Mr. Cushing relative to Zu&ntilde;i customs;
and the author is inclined to favor it rather
than the other.</p>

<p><b>Estrays from Civilization.</b>&mdash;A curious
study of a community of estrays from civilization
who are leading the life of savages is
published by M. Zaborowski in the <i>Revue de
l'&Eacute;cole d'Anthropologie</i> and <i>La Nature</i>. The
settlement is about a mile from Ezy, on the
eastern edge of the plateau of Normandy, in
a group of caves that were excavated and
used as wine cellars when, several hundred
years ago, wine culture flourished in the now
uncongenial region. Later the spot was a
resort for picnics till the old buildings fell
into decay, and about fifty years ago it was
given up to wanderers. About eighty men,
women, and children live there, the adults,
though not perhaps really criminals, having
been lost to society on account of some offense
committed against it. They have no
regular means of subsistence, are beneath
the tramps in grade, and possess, with one or
two exceptions, no articles of property other
than what they pick up. Their beds are
wooden bunks set upon stones, filled with
leaves, and the coverings are wrapping canvas.
A "family" of seven persons lived in
one of the cellars with only a single bed of
this kind. Their kitchen utensils are old tin
cans picked out of rubbish heaps, and their
stoves are obtained in the same way, or often
consist of plates and pieces of iron adjusted
so as to make a sort of fireplace. They have
a well from which they draw water with
some old kettle suspended on a hooked stick,
each "family" having its own hook. Their
clothes are rags, partly covering portions of
the body, and it is not considered necessary
that the younger ones should have even these.
Their housekeeping and their ideas of neatness
are such as might correspond with these
conditions. One woman, mother of four
children, and the only one that was adequately
dressed, was a native of a neighboring
village, and had been brought to the
cave by her mother when she was eight years
old. An old man had been a charge upon
the town and was sent to the cave by the
<i>maire</i> to get rid of him. He had found a
woman there and had several children. A
woman, still active, who had lived in the
caves three years, had children living in Ezy.
The complaint, so common in other parts of
France, that the natural increase of population
has failed, does not apply to the caves.
Five or six of the "families" have four or
five children. On these children, of whom
only the most vigorous survive, "the influence
of their debasing misery and of the
vices of their parents impresses a common
aspect. Their mental condition has fallen
shockingly low, and, their physical needs
satisfied, they seem to want nothing further.
No attraction will induce them to attend
school, which is like imprisonment to them.
Their mode of life and the marks of degradation
in their faces separate them from
others. Earnest attempts to develop their
intelligence and moral consciousness have
been without result."</p>

<p><b>German School Journeys.</b>&mdash;It is very
common in Germany, says Miss Dodd, of
Owens College, in one of the English educational
reports, to find definite teaching taking
place outside the school walls&mdash;in the
gardens attached to the schools, and in the
neighboring forests, where the children are
instructed in observation of the local forms
of plant and animal life. Further, they are
often taken on longer expeditions to spend
the whole day in the forest or on the mountain
with their teachers, who direct them
"what to see, and how to see it." More definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
and more ambitious than these minor excursions
is the school journey, which may last
from three days to three weeks. It is usually
taken on foot, and is as inexpensive as possible,
with plain food and simple accommodation.
Each boy carries his own knapsack
charged with a change of underclothing,
towels, soap, etc., and overcoat or umbrella;
while for the common use of the party
are distributed clothes brushes and shoe
brushes, needles, thread, string, and pins,
ointment for rubbing on the feet, a small
medicine chest, a compass, a field glass, a
pocket microscope, a barometer, and a tape
measure. The district visited is chosen on
account of its historical associations or the
geographical illustrations it furnishes, or the
richness and variety of plant life to be
studied. Constant pauses are made to afford
opportunities for the examination of features
inviting study; and the scenes visited are
often closely connected with the subjects included
in the year's work of the school. In
a journey, of which Miss Dodd was a member,
preparations were begun three months
beforehand, with the collection of subscriptions,
drawing of road maps, and special lessons.
The fifty boys from ten to fifteen years
old, marched off in groups of four, assorting
themselves according to their affinities
for companionship, with advance and rear
guards; the regions passed through were
explored for what might be found in
them; the roads were marked and identified,
mountains and rivers were named, and
the courses of streams determined; and at
each place of considerable interest its characteristic
features and associations of Nature,
art, and history were discussed and
studied.</p>

<p><b>The Huichol Indians of Jalisco.</b>&mdash;The
Huichol Indians of Mexico, the subject of a
study by Carl Lumholtz, four thousand people
living in the mountains of northern Jalisco,
have a tradition that they originated in
the south, got lost underneath the earth, and
came forward again in the east, in the country
of the <i>Kikuli</i>, near San Luis Potosi.
Franciscan missionaries converted them nominally
to Christianity, but there are now no
priests in their country, and there is probably
no tribe in Mexico where the ancient
beliefs have been so well maintained as with
them. Their exterior conditions have been
somewhat altered by the introduction of cattle
and sheep, and cattle are now the favorite
animals for sacrifice at the feasts for making
rain during the dry season. The people
are healthy, very emotional, easily moved to
laughter or tears, imaginative and excitable.
Young people show affection in public, kissing
or caressing one another. They are kind-hearted
and not inhospitable to those who
can gain their confidence, but have the reputation
of being wanting in regard for truth.
They live mostly in circular houses made
from loose stones, or stones and mud, and
covered with thatched roofs. Their temples,
devoted to various gods, are of similar shape,
but much larger, with the entrances toward
sunrise. Outside of the door is an open
space surrounded by small rectangular god-houses,
with gabled and thatched roofs. The
god-houses are also frequently found in the
forests, and are sometimes circular. There
are nineteen temples in the country which
are frequented at the times of the feasts,
when the officials and their families camp
in the small god-houses. Idols are not kept
in the temples, but are hidden in caves or in
special buildings. There are a great many
sacred caves devoted to various gods, and
generally containing some pool or spring that
gives them sanctity, and the water of which
is supposed to have salutary virtues. Much
religious importance is attached to the <i>Kikuli</i>
cactus, which produces an exhilarating effect
on the system. Ceremonial arrows are inseparably
connected with their life, the arrow
representing the Indian himself in his
prayers to the gods. They have other interesting
ceremonies and ceremonial objects,
and a curious system of distilling, which Mr.
Lumholtz describes at length.</p>

<p><b>Herrings at Dinner.</b>&mdash;The food of the
herring consists of small organisms, often of
microscopic dimensions. It is entirely animal,
and in Europe, according to those who
have investigated the matter, it consists of
copepods, schizopods (shrimplike forms),
amphipods (sand fleas and their allies), the
embryos of gasteropods and lamellibranchia,
and young fishes, often of its own kind. In
the examination of about fifteen hundred
specimens of herring at Eastport, Maine, and
vicinity, in the summer and fall of 1893, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
H.F. Moore, of the Fish Commission, found
only two kinds of food&mdash;copepods or "red
seed," which appeared to constitute the sole
food of the small herrings, and shrimps the
principal food of the larger ones. In many
cases the stomachs of the fish were densely
gorged with these shrimps, which are extremely
abundant in the waters of the vicinity.
Excepting the eyes and phosphorescent
spots beneath, which are bright red, the
bodies of the crustaceans are almost transparent,
yet such is the density of the schools
in which they congregate that a distinctly
reddish tinge is often imparted to the water.
They are very active, and frequently avoid
the rush of the fish by vigorous strokes of
their powerful caudal paddles, which throw
them several inches above the surface. To
capture them requires some address on the
part of the herring, and the fish likewise frequently
throw themselves almost clear of the
surface. When feeding upon copepods the
movements of the herrings are less impetuous.
They swim open-mouthed, often with
their snouts at the surface, crossing and recrossing
on their tracks, and evidently straining
out the minute crustaceans by means of
their branchial sieves. After they have passed
the stage known as "brit," the herrings appear
to feed principally at night, or if they
do so to any considerable extent during bright
daylight it is at such a depth that they escape
observation. At night it is often possible to
note the movements of the fish at a depth of
several fathoms, and at such times Mr. Moore
has seen them swimming back and forth,
"apparently screening the water, their every
movement traced by a phosphorescent gleam,
evoked perhaps from the very organisms
which they were consuming." The herrings
evidently follow their prey by night, and the
fact that the shrimps possess phosphorescent
spots may explain the apparent ability of the
fish to catch them then.</p>


<h3>MINOR PARAGRAPHS.</h3>

<p>The phosphorescence, which is so beautiful
a characteristic of certain forms of animal
life in the sea, has been the cause of
much speculation among the fishermen and
scientists; none of the proposed theories
have been entirely satisfactory. It is now
stated, however, that an adequate and provable
cause has been discovered in a so-called
species of photo-bacteria; by means of this
germ it is stated that sea water, containing
nutrient media, can be inoculated and rendered
phosphorescent; that newly caught
herrings with the sea water still fresh can be
rendered phosphorescent by a treatment
which favors the growth of the photo-bacteria.
Oxygen is an essential to their growth.</p>

<p>Personal equation was defined by Prof.
T.H. Safford, in a paper read at the American
Association, as in reality the time it takes to
think; and as that time is different in different
persons, observations are liable to be affected
by it unless correct allowance is made
for it in the case of each one. It has been a
subject of discussion since the end of the
last century. The Astronomer Royal of
England discharged a good assistant in 1795,
because he was liable to observe stars more
than half a second too late. Bond, several
years afterward, took the subject up and
found that astronomers were liable to vary a
little in their observations; some to anticipate
the time by a trifle, and others falling a
little behind. The subject has since been
studied by Professor Wundt. In the days when
the eye-and-ear method of observation prevailed,
the astronomer had both to watch his
object and to keep note of the time; with
the introduction of the chronograph, the
errors resulting from this necessity are in
part obviated. But error enough still exists
to be troublesome.</p>

<p>The Educational Extension Work in Agriculture
of Cornell University Experiment Station
is carried on by the publication and distribution
of leaflets, visitation of teachers'
institutes, and other means that may bring
the station in contact with the people. The
results of the work have been generally satisfactory.
Eight leaflets, on such subjects as
How a Squash Plant gets out of the Seed,
A Children's Garden, etc., were published
last year in from two to six editions, and still
meet a lively demand. Thirty thousand teachers
were enrolled on the lists as receiving
leaflets, or as students of methods of presenting
Nature study to their pupils, sixteen
thousand school children were receiving leaflets
suitable to them, and twenty-five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
young farmers were enrolled in the
Agricultural Reading Course. Much interest
seems to have been shown by farmers in
sugar-beet culture, in investigations of which
more than three hundred of them are cooperating
with the station, and two hundred
in experiments with fertilizers.</p>


<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p>An important feature in the evolution of
trade journalism is pointed out in the presidential
address of E.C. Brown, of the American
Trade Press Association, in the establishment
of small trade journals, covering limited
fields. Such industries as brickmaking, stenography,
advertising, acetylene, hospital
practice, etc., are ably represented by their
respective trade journals; and this tendency
is promoted by the complementary one of
the trades, in their centralization and concentration,
compelling even journals in the same
business to make their field distinct and restricted.
The public demands specific information,
not for the purpose of catering to a
passing interest, but for its application directly
in the conduct of business or the formation
of a policy; and those trade journals
succeed best which supply accurate information
of value to their readers.</p>

<p>The ascent of Mont Blanc was accomplished
between June 21st and September
16th by one hundred and nineteen persons,
eleven of whom were women. By nationality
the climbers included forty-four
Frenchmen and eleven Frenchwomen, fifteen
Englishmen and one Englishwoman, and fifteen
Swiss, with Germans, Americans, Belgians,
Hollanders, Irish, and Russians. A
Belgian lady and a Dutch lady were of this
company. A Frenchwoman, seventy-five
years old, was one of the party that reached
the summit on one of the last days in September.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace Brown, whose interesting
researches on the enzymes have attracted
much attention during the past few years,
has recently announced the results of some
important experiments on the vitality of
seeds. He found that certain seeds subjected
to the very low temperature of evaporating
liquid air, about -192&deg; C., for one hundred
and ten consecutive hours, retained perfectly
their power of germinating.</p>

<p>The report made by Prof. W.A. Herdman
to the British Association concerning
the liability to disease through oysters recognizes
the possibility of contamination through
the proximity of the beds to sewage water,
and recommends steps to be taken, through
either legislative control or association, to
induce the oyster trade to remove any possible
suspicion of contamination of the beds;
provision for the inspection of foreign oysters
or their subjection to a quarantine by deposition
for a stated period in British waters, as
already takes place in many instances; and
the periodical inspection of the grounds from
which mussels, cockles, and periwinkles are
gathered.</p>

<p>As the result of long-continued observations
of annual temperatures the appearance
of the earliest leaves, and the return of birds
of passage, M. Camille Flammarion has published
the conclusions that the maximum
temperatures correspond with abundant sun
spots and the least humidity, and the minimum
temperatures with scarcity of sun spots
and great humidity; and that sparrows begin
to sit when horse-chestnuts, lilacs, and
peonies begin to bloom, and the young are
hatched about two days after these plants
are in full inflorescence. M. Flammarion
also believes that the temperatures of March
and April indicate those of the entire year.</p>

<p>Little steel capsules containing a small
quantity of liquefied carbonic acid are made,
<i>La Nature</i> says, at Zurich, Switzerland. One
of them is placed in the neck of a bottle of
water which is provided with a faucet and
the capsule is pricked. The carbonic acid
escapes and charges the water, and a bottle
of soda water is the result. The capsules
are cheap and convenient, and are very popular
in Switzerland and Germany.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In 1872, while a Commissioner of Health, I had occasion to examine and report on
the causes of the high death rate during the summer months in the city of New York. The
chief cause was determined to be the excessive heat which characterizes those months. It
was recommended in the report to the Board of Health that legislation be secured empowering
and requiring the Department of Parks to plant and cultivate trees, shrubs, plants,
and vines in all the streets, avenues, and public places in the city. A bill was drafted
and introduced into the Legislature, but it did not become a law, and no further effort has
been made to secure such legislation. Meantime, two tree-planting societies have been
established, one in the Borough of Brooklyn and the other in the Borough of Manhattan,
which are endeavoring to awaken public interest to the importance of planting a suitable
number and variety of trees in the streets for purposes of ornamentation. The aim of this
paper, which is largely based on the report of 1872, is to revive the project of giving the
Department of Parks jurisdiction over the trees in the streets, and require it to plant and
cultivate additional trees, shrubs, plants, and other forms of vegetation for the improvement
of the public health and for the purpose of ornamentation.</p></div>

finds an explanation of the so-called theory of Ricardo, that the rent which a farmer
of agricultural land pays as the price of its hire&mdash;that is to say, the price which he pays for
the exclusive use of it&mdash;is no part of the cost of the crops he may raise upon it; a conclusion
that can not be possibly true, unless it be also true that rent is paid for something that
is not an indispensable condition of agricultural production. "Thus rights are in their very
nature impalpable and invisible. They are not material things, but relations between many
material things and the human mind and will. The right of exclusive use over land is a
thing invisible and immaterial, as other rights are, and, although it is, and has been since
the world began, the basis of all agricultural industry, it is a basis impalpable and invisible,
whereas the material visible implements and tools, whose work depends upon it, are all visible
and palpable enough, and all of which would never be were we to see them without the
invisible rights upon which they depend. All of the former, in their place and order, are
instruments of production; all of them catch the eye, and may easily engross the attention.
On the other hand, if we are induced to forget those other elements, which are equally
essential instruments of production, merely because they are out of sight, then our deception
may be complete, and fallacies which become glaring when memory and attention are
awakened may find in our half-vacant minds an easy and even a cordial reception."

Adam Smith may be fairly considered as having fully committed himself beyond all controversy
in his great work, The Wealth of Nations, to the principle that taxes, with a degree
of infallibility, diffuse themselves when they are levied uniformly on the same article; and
he even goes so far as to admit that a tax upon labor, if it could be uniformly levied
and collected, would be diffused, and that the laborer would be the mere conduit through
which the tax would pass to the public treasury. Thus he says, "While the demand for
labor and the price of provisions, therefore, remain the same, a direct tax upon wages can
have no other effect than to raise them somewhat higher than the tax."
</p>
<p>
The German economist Bluntschli, who has carefully studied this question of the final
incidence of all just and equitable taxes, is in substantial agreement with the above conclusions,
but prefers to use a different term for characterizing such finality than consumption,
and expresses himself as follows: "In the end taxes fall on <i>enjoyments</i>. Hence the amount
of each man's enjoyments and not his income is the justest measure of taxation." (Bluntschli,
vol. x, p. 146.)
</p>
<p>
M. Thiers, the French statesman and economist, was also a believer and earnest advocate
of the theory of the diffusion of taxes, and lays down his principles in the following
words: "Taxes are shifted indefinitely, and tend to become a part of the price of commodities,
to such an extent that every one bears his share, not in proportion to what he pays the
state, but in proportion to what he consumes." And in his book Rights to Property he thus
illustrates the method in which taxation diffuses itself: "In the same manner as our
senses, deceived by appearances, tell us that it is the sun which moves and not the earth,
so a particular tax appears to fall upon one class, and another tax upon another class,
when in reality it is not so. The tax really best suited to the poorest member of society is
that which is best suited to the general fortune of the state; a fortune which is much more
for the possession and enjoyment of the poor man than it is for the rich; a fact of which
we are never sufficiently convinced. But of the manner, nevertheless, in which taxes are
divided among the different classes of the state, the most certain thing we can say is: That
they are divided in proportion to what each man consumes, and for a reason not generally
recognized or understood, namely, that taxes are reflected, as it were, to infinity, and from
reflection to reflection become eventually an integral part of the prices of things. Hence
the greatest purchasers and consumers are everywhere the greatest taxpayers. This is
what I call '<i>diffusion of taxation</i>,' to borrow a term from physical science, which applies
the expression 'diffusion of light' to those numberless reflections, in consequence of which
the light which has penetrated the slightest aperture spreads itself around in every direction,
and in such a manner as to reach all the objects which it renders visible. So a tax
which at first sight appears to be paid directly, in reality is only advanced by the individual
who is first called upon to pay it."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> As applied to the wages of labor, the truth of this principle is equally incontestable.
"The sewing girl performing her toilsome work by the needle at one dollar a day, the street
sweeper working the mud with his broom at a dollar and a half, the skilled laborer at two
and three dollars, the professor at five, the editor at five or ten, the artist and the songstress
at ten or five hundred dollars a day are all members of the working classes, though working
at different rates. And it is only the difference in their effectiveness that causes the difference
in their earnings. Bring them all to the same point of efficiency, and their earnings
also will be the same."&mdash;<i>W. Jungst, Cincinnati.</i>
</p>
<p>
John Locke, in his treatise On the Standard of Value, treats of taxation, and shows
conclusively that if all lands were nominally free from taxation, the owners of lands
would proportionally pay more taxes than now, because the same amount of money must
continue to be collected in some form, and the average profits of lands would only be equal
to the average profits of other investments; and further, that the expense and annoyance
(another form of expense) would be increased if the tax were exclusively levied in the first
instance upon personal property; and hence the landowner would be burdened with his
proportion of the unnecessary expense and annoyance. He also shows that you may change
the form of a uniform tax, but that you can not change the burden; and that the change
will increase the burden, if the new system is more expensive and annoying than the old.
Locke wrote nearly a century before Adam Smith published his Wealth of Nations, and it
would seem probable that Smith acquired his ideas relative to the average profits of investments
from Locke.</p></div>

also are caused by the ctesohedonic fallacy. Suppose each one of them might have earned
$20 a year. Capitalized at four per cent, this sum would have amounted to $400,000,000.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> See my Luttes, p. 228. Let us say, in passing, that we owe our existing savagery
partly to the ctesohedonic fallacy. When we think that the most rapid way of enriching
ourselves is by seizing our neighbor's territories, the fewer defenders that territory has, the
better. So all pretended political geniuses glorify themselves on having killed the largest
number of their fellow-men. C&aelig;sar boasted of having killed a million and a half of Gauls.
At the moment of writing these lines a terrible accident has occurred at Santander. Hundreds
of persons were killed by the explosion of a boat loaded with dynamite. Great
pity was expressed for the victims. Collections for their benefit were taken in France.
Suppose France and Spain were now at war. If somebody had blown up some thousand
Spaniards in a fortress, we should have sung <i>Te Deums</i>. Oh, man's logic!</p></div>
